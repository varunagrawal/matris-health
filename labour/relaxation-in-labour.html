<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>The benefits of relaxation in labour</h2>
In labour, relaxation performs many of the same functions as it does in everyday life. Staying relaxed in labour has many benefits such as:<ul><li>It prevents your muscles from becoming tired, especially the large muscles of the uterus (womb).</li><li>It helps you cope better with the stresses of giving birth and enjoy the experience more.</li><li>It helps conserve your energy, so that you are less likely to need interventions to strengthen your contractions or to deliver your baby.</li><li>It helps you communicate more effectively with the doctor, nurses and aayas attending to you. It also allows you to understand what they are saying to you.</ul></li>And equally importantly:
<br/><ul><li>Relaxation helps your baby to cope with labour. If you are relaxed, you won't flood your baby's system with stress hormones that cause his heart rate to speed up. Staying relaxed also means that you breathe more deeply, so that your baby gets more oxygen.</ul></li>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Can you really relax in labour?</h2>
It's certainly not easy, but a few simple techniques can help, especially if you have the support of a birth companion or someone close to you. Being well supported in labour has repeatedly been shown to be the single most important factor in determining a positive birth experience for the woman and a positive outcome for her baby. The birth companion should have good endurance and should be able to make you happy.
<br/>
<br/>You might find it very hard to relax during contractions, but remember that most women are totally free of pain and discomfort in between contractions. This is the ideal time to relax those parts of your body that you know become tense (see <b>Know your body</b>, below). Your birth companion can help you relax with massages and with reassurance and encouragement. If you cannot have a family member with you when you are in labour, you can ask the hospital aaya to give you a massage if you feel like one. Sometimes the hospital aayas may expect a reward from you in cash or in kind for any assistance that they provide to you during or after your delivery. Usually the hospital rules do not allow their workers to accept rewards from patients, but the workers may still insist on it, so it is best to come prepared.
<br/>
<br/>Focusing on your <a href="breathing-techniques-for-labour.html">breathing</a> both during and between contractions will also help. Take a deep breath at the beginning of every contraction and, as you sigh out, try to relax. Then focus on a word or phrase as a distraction technique. Hum "ba-by" to yourself under your breath. Or repeat "re-lax" over and over again. You can even chant a favourite prayer. Follow this by a pause before beginning a new breathing cycle. If you are in the habit of meditating, you may have a special mantra or a positive affirmation that you may find useful now.
<br/>
<br/>You can also visualise a smooth delivery of your baby. When you visualise your baby as he moves down through your pelvis, send him positive thoughts that he is loved and that you are there to help him. These forms of concentration divert your attention from pain, help to reduce your anxiety or fear, keep you calm, and through all this, ease your delivery.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Choose the right environment</h2>
The first step towards relaxation is to create an environment that supports and nurtures you. This means choosing a doctor you can trust and a delivery place you are comfortable with. It is advisable to choose your doctor and your hospital carefully early in your pregnancy.
<br/>
<br/>Wear your own clothes for as long as possible (a loose top with elastic jogging trousers or loose kurta-salwar are ideal, a loose nighty or petticoat- blouse will also do). If the hospital permits, bring some extra pillows from home.
<br/>
<br/>Some private hospitals may also provide a music system to play calming music, or if your hospital permits, you can bring your own music player. Music can help to distract you from your pain, anxiety, or fear. It can also have a calming and relaxing effect on you. Some ragas considered to have soothing and sedating effects on a woman in labour include Raga Kalavati, Nayakikanda, Malkauns, Jayjaywanti, Jaunpuri and Asawari.
<br/>
<br/>Sheila Kitzinger, a leading UK expert on birth, says that women should deliver their babies in an environment similar to the one in which they conceived them - in other words, one that is dimly lit, cosy, comfortable and intimate. It's worth thinking about, though it may not always be in your control to create such an environment for your baby to arrive.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Know your body</h2>
During your pregnancy, whenever you become stressed, stop and think about which parts of your body are becoming tense. Do you frown when you are worried? Or grind your teeth? Clench your fists? Or get tummy ache? Do your neck and shoulders feel tight and painful? These are all signs that your muscles are in a state of tension, causing them to become sore and tired.
<br/>
<br/>Take a deep breath and, as you breathe out, let the muscles in question relax so that they feel loose and soft, rather than rigid. Practise this technique regularly - not only when you notice tension in your muscles, but before situations you know can cause you stress. This way, by the time you go into labour you will automatically be able to identify areas of tension in your body and to relax them. It will also do wonders for your blood pressure.
<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id='section5' name='section5'>If possible communicate clearly</h2>
You won't be able to relax during labour if:
<br/><ul><li>You don't know what's happening to you.</li><li>You don't understand what the doctors are doing.</li><li>You feel that there are conversations going on that you're not part of.</li><li>You are unsure about aspects of your labour.</li><li>You're frightened for your own or your baby's safety.</li><li>There are too many people in the room.</ul></li>Sometimes doctors, especially at the government hospitals, may not talk to you in detail about what is happening. You may need to ask your doctor to explain what is happening. If you have a birth companion, one of her most important roles is to keep you informed.
<br/>
<br/>The hospital may have a specific policy about visitors and attendants inside the labour room. If you feel the room is too crowded ask your doctor to instruct relatives to wait outside. If you are constantly interrupted by hospital staff, ask your doctor for some privacy. Turn your mobile off so that you can focus on your labour.
<br/>
<br/>Ask your doctor to help you achieve the best possible labour for you. If she goes off duty, make sure that you speak to the next doctor who cares for you. And seek her support, too.
