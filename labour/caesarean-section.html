					<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>What is a caesarean section?</h2>
					A caesarean section (or &#39;c-section&#39;) is an operation in which an obstetrician makes a cut through your belly and uterus (womb) so that your baby can be born. It&#39;s the most common major surgery that women have.
					<br />
					<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>What&#39;s the difference between a planned and an emergency caesarean?</h2>
					If the operation is pre-planned or of your choice, it is called an &quot;elective&quot; caesarean. An emergency caesarean, on the other hand, is one that&#39;s undertaken urgently. It is performed when the health of the mother or her baby (or both) is believed to be at risk.
					<br />
					<br />
					An elective caesarean is usually scheduled to take place when a pregnancy has reached term but before labour begins. This is typically at 37 to 40 weeks.
					<br />
					<br />
					Most emergency caesarean sections are undertaken after labour has begun. Occasionally, an emergency caesarean may have to be performed in late pregnancy (beyond the 28th week) if complications develop suddenly.
					<br />
					<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Why might I need an elective caesarean section?</h2>
					A caesarean section is recommended when vaginal delivery might pose a risk to the mother or her baby.
					<br />
					<br />
					In certain cases, doctors may decide well in advance to undertake a planned c-section. Usually they would explain to you and your family why a planned c-section is necessary. The reasons might include:
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">You&#39;re having a genital herpes outbreak, which can be passed on to your baby if he&#39;s delivered vaginally.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Your baby is in a breech (bottom first) or transverse (sideways) position, or has a known fetal illness or abnormality.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">You are carrying three or more babies.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">You have placenta praevia (when the placenta is implanted so low in your uterus that it blocks your baby&#39;s exit), or abruptio placenta, when your placenta is separated from your uterine wall and your baby is at risk</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Your pre-eclampsia is rapidly worsening, making it dangerous to delay delivery.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">You have a history of uterine surgery or multiple caesarean sections.</li>
					</ul>
					Even if none of the above conditions is present in your case, your doctor may schedule an elective caesarean if you or your family insists. This would typically happen if you do not want a vaginal birth because of your fear of labour pains. Occasionally, a doctor may perform an elective caesarean if a woman and her family want the baby to arrive on a particular auspicious day, for astrological reasons.
					<br />
					<br />
					Before you or your family decide that you would like a planned caesarean for reasons other than those suggested by your doctor, think carefully. Be aware that you are more likely to develop complications, such as infection and fever, after a caesarean birth. And a caesarean may not be the best option for your baby either. Ultimately, your doctor will be best able to judge if an elective c-section is a safe and sensible option.
					<br />
					<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Why might I need an emergency caesarean section?</h2>
					Some women may require an urgent and unplanned caesarean even though they were expected to have a normal vaginal birth. An emergency caesarean may have to be undertaken if:
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">You were planning a caesarean, but went into labour before the operation. In this case, your caesarean can be done within a few hours of your labour starting, as long as you and your baby are well.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">You or your baby have developed a life-threatening complication during pregnancy or labour. Your baby should be born as soon as possible to ensure the safety of both of you. </li>
					</ul>
					Your labour has stalled, or is very slow because:
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">your birth passage is unusually narrow, or the baby too large</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">your baby is lying in an awkward position</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">your contractions are not strong enough to open the cervix</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					These conditions lead to failure of normal vaginal birth and can endanger your baby&#39;s life.
					<br />
					<br />
					In addition, an unplanned emergency caesarean may become necessary when any of the following happen during your labour:
					<br />
					<br />
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">The forceps or ventouse-assisted vaginal delivery (or both) have failed</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Your baby&#39;s heart rate has become irregular, which means that he may not be able to withstand a vaginal delivery.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">The umbilical cord slips out (prolapses) through your cervix before your baby is born. There&#39;s a great risk that the prolapsed cord may become compressed during 
							<ul>
								<li>Your placenta has separated from your uterus wall. </li>
								<li>You lose a huge amount of blood, your heart rate becomes very high or you have very high blood pressure.</li>
							</ul>
					
					</ul>
						
					<h2 id='section5' name='section5'>What will happen before my caesarean?</h2>
						
					Your doctor may discuss the procedure with you and your family. She may:
					<br />
					<br />
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">explain why she thinks you need the operation</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">tell you what will happen during the caesarean section</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">explain any possible risks to you and your baby</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">tell you about the kind of anesthesia that will be given to you during the procedure, and the risks and benefits of using it</li>
					</ul>
						Sometimes, doctors may not be able to explain every detail to you and your family owing to their heavy patient load. But most doctors will inform you about the risks to you or your baby&#39;s health if they were to avoid a caesarean section. They will also take written consent from you and your family to operate on you, after explaining what you may expect from the operation.
						<br />
						<br />
						If you are having a planned caesarean done under a general anaesthetic, you will be told not to eat anything for at least six hours before the operation. You will only be allowed sips of water. If you happen to need a general anaesthetic during an emergency c-section, the contents of your stomach will be pumped out through a rubber tube.
						<br />
						<br />
						Your husband is usually not allowed to go with you into the operating theater. Even in the rare hospital that permits this, if your caesarean section turns into a true emergency, or if you need a general anaesthetic, your husband will be asked to leave.
						<br />
						<br />
						Before the surgery, you&#39;ll be prepared in the following ways:
						<br />
						<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item">You&#39;ll be asked to change into a sterilized hospital gown.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">You&#39;ll have to take off all your jewellery.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">If you have a brace or false teeth, you&#39;ll need to remove them, too.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">If you are wearing any make-up and nail varnish, they will also be removed. This is so your skin tone can be monitored during the operation. </li>
							<li class="list-group-item">You won&#39;t be able to wear contact lenses or glasses.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">At some hospitals, a sample of your blood will be taken to check that your iron levels are high enough and you haven&#39;t got anaemia. If are anaemic and happen to have huge blood loss, you will need a blood transfusion. The hospital will make preparations for this.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">You&#39;ll be made to lie on your back on an operating table. The table may be tilted or wedged to the left so the weight of your uterus doesn&#39;t reduce the blood supply to your lungs and make your blood pressure drop.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">A drip will be inserted into a vein in your arm. This will give you fluids and make it easy to give you drugs if you need them during the operation or later.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">You&#39;ll be given an anaesthetic. Depending on the type of anaesthesia used, your position on the operation table may be changed. Regional anaesthesia - a spinal or an epidural - may be used. This type of anaesthesia numbs your bottom half and is safer for you and your baby than a general anaesthetic, which puts you to sleep.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">A thin tube, or catheter, will be inserted into your bladder via your urethra. This will make sure your bladder is empty.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">The area on your tummy where the cut will be made will be shaved and cleaned with an antiseptic. Then it is covered with special sterile sheets, which are cut in the centre, so that only the part to be operated on remains exposed.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">You may be given blood-thinning injections to reduce the risk of a clot forming in one of your leg veins.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">You&#39;ll have a cuff put on your arm to monitor your blood pressure.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">Your anesthesia expert will monitor your heart rate at all times, before, during and after the operation. Your heart rate may be monitored manually or electronically. If you are being monitored electronically, electrodes will be put on your chest. You may have a finger-pulse monitor attached, too.</li>
						</ul>
					
						You&#39;ll be given:
						<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item">an injection of antibiotics to ward off infection</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">anti-sickness medicine to stop you from vomiting</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">strong pain relief during and just after the caesarean</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">pain relief for lasting soreness</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">oxygen through a mask, if your baby is in distress.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">You may be surprised by how many people are needed to perform a caesarean section; the operating theatre will be full of people all busy doing their specific jobs.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2 id='section6' name='section6'>What happens during a caesarean?</h2>
						Once your lower body is completely numb, the doctor will make a small horizontal cut into your skin, about two fingers&#39; width above your pubic bone. This type of cut is called a bikini cut.
						<br />
						<br />
						Less commonly, the doctor may make a vertical cut, extending from two fingers&#39; width above your pubic bone to an inch below your belly button. Bikini cuts are favoured more nowadays, as they tend to heal better.
						<br />
						<br />
						The layers of tissue and muscle are opened to reach your uterus. Your tummy muscles are parted, rather than cut. Your bladder will be moved down to expose the lower part of your uterus.
						<br />
						<br />
						Your doctor then makes a second cut, in the lower section of your uterus. This cut is usually small. Your doctor will make it bigger using scissors or fingers, so that it is torn. This causes less bleeding than a sharp cut. These days the opening is usually made in the lower part of the uterus. This is why the operation is sometimes called a lower segment caesarean section (LSCS).
						<br />
						<br />
						The bag of membranes is opened, and you may hear fluid gushing out. Your baby is then lifted out. You may be aware of the assistant pressing on your belly to help your baby be born. If your baby is breech, he will be born bottom first. It only takes a few minutes to take your baby out.
						<br />
						<br />
						Your baby will be quickly checked over by the paediatrician, if he or she is available. At some hospitals the paediatrician may have to be summoned, or your doctor may hand over your baby to one of her trained and experienced assistants or staff. Your baby is then shown to you.
						<br />
						<br />
						After your baby is born, your doctor will gently tug the umbilical cord to pull out the placenta.
						<br />
						<h2 id='section7' name='section7'>What happens when my baby is born?</h2>
						After your baby is born, his cord is clamped and cut. He is cleaned and his initial checks are made. He is given
						<a href="/a3074/apgar-scale">Apgar scores</a> at one minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes after birth. The scores measure your baby&#39;s wellbeing.
						<br />
						<br />
						If your baby is well, he is simply kept covered and warm. But if your baby is very small or unwell, he may need more attention from the paediatrician. He may need to go straight to the paediatric intensive care unit.
						<br />
						<br />
						Your doctor will concentrate on stitching you up. Each layer of muscle and skin needs to be closed using clamps, staples, or sutures. Your doctor will probably use a double layer of stitches to repair your uterus. Finally, your skin wound will be closed with stitches or staples.
						<br />
						<br />
						When you&#39;re ready, you&#39;ll be moved to your ward where you, your husband and, if all is well, your baby (or babies) can be together. You may start shivering, because your body temperature drops during the operation. Your nurse will warm you up with blankets and help you breastfeed your baby. You may find it more comfortable if you both lie on your side and face each other. It often takes some time to find comfortable feeding positions</a> after a caesarean, but it&#39;s worth persevering, and it does get easier.
						<br />
						<h2 id='section8' name='section8'>Can I minimise my chances of having a caesarean birth?</h2>
						Many caesareans save the life of the mother or baby, or both, so not all should be avoided. But here are some ways that may help you reduce your chances of having one:
						<br />
						<br/>
						<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item"><a href="../diet/10-steps-to-a-healthy-pregnancy.html">Stay healthy</a> during pregnancy, <a href="../diet/diet-for-a-healthy-pregnancy">eat well</a>, exercise and get plenty of rest. When labour starts you&#39;ll be in optimal condition.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">Find out which doctor or local hospital has the lowest section rate. Your friends, colleagues or relatives who have recently had a baby can help you make your choice.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">Keep upright as long as you can during labour. Walking and standing can speed the process up by making your contractions stronger, longer, and more effective. Even sitting, rather than lying down, can significantly cut the length of labour.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">Remember to drink fluids during labour to prevent dehydration and keep your energy levels up.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2 id='section9' name='section9'>I had my first baby by caesarean. Can I deliver my next baby vaginally?</h2>
						Having a surgical delivery does not mean, as it once did, that you&#39;ll have your future children by caesarean section as well. In fact, many women who try a vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC)</a> succeed.
						<br />
						<br />
						Horizontal (or &#39;bikini&#39;) cuts have greatly reduced the risk of future uterine rupture, so more doctors are willing to let their patients undergo a &#39;trial of labour&#39;.
						<br />
						<br />
						Discuss the options with your doctor. She may opt for a planned repeat caesarean if you&#39;ve already had several caesareans, or if your baby is large, or at risk. You may wish to seek a second opinion if you haven&#39;t had any complications this time and your doctor still insists on a caesarean section.
