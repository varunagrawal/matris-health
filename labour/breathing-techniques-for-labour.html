					<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>How does breathing help in labour?</h2>
					Rhythmic breathing during labour maximises the amount of oxygen available to you and your baby. Breathing techniques can also help you cope with the pain of contractions.
					<br />
					<br />When you are tense and frightened, your breathing becomes shallow and rapid. Your shoulders are pulled up towards your ears and your neck and shoulder muscles feel tight and rigid. If you move into a state of panic, you start over-breathing, sucking the air into your lungs and breathing out in short, sharp gasps.
					<br />
					<br />Panic breathing cuts down on the amount of oxygen you take in for yourself and for your baby. You feel light-headed and out of control. Pins and needles start in your fingers and your mouth feels numb.
					<br />
					<br />Panic-breathing is a common reaction to very stressful or frightening situations. It's normal, but your body can't continue in this state for long without becoming exhausted. In labour, your aim is to conserve your energy as much as possible, and give your baby plenty of oxygen to help him cope with the stress of being born. Rhythmic breathing can help you do this.
					<br />
					<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Breathing patterns for labour</h2>
					Start by noticing your usual breathing pattern. Close your eyes for a moment now and focus on your breathing.
					<br />
					<br />Notice how rhythmical it is. You breathe in, then there's a slight pause before you breathe out. Your out-breath matches your in-breath in length and depth. You pause slightly before your lungs draw the next breath in.
					<br />
					<br />In labour, try to keep your breathing rhythmical. Don't let the in-breath become longer than the out-breath. If anything, your out-breath should be longer than your in-breath.
					<br />
					<br />When you are having very strong contractions, your breathing will become shallower. There's nothing wrong with this as long as your breathing doesn't start to get faster and faster and turn into panic-breathing.
					<br />
					<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Simple breathing techniques</h2>
					In some hospitals, yoga or breathing experts might be available to guide you. They will show you the correct way of breathing during contractions and also in between them. Sometimes your doctor might instruct you about the breathing pattern you should follow. We describe a few breathing techniques which you may want to practice during pregnancy. These techniques will help you to synchronize your breathing with contractions.
					<br />
					<br />Try the following breathing techniques:
					<br />
					<br />
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">Think of the word "relax". It has two syllables, "re" and "lax". Now try this exercise. As you breathe in, think "re" to yourself, and as you breathe out, think "lax". Don't let your mind wander away from repeating the word "relax"' in tune with your breathing. When you breathe out, try to let go of any tensions in your body. Focus on the muscles which you know become tense when you're stressed. Remember, every time you breathe out: "laaaax". The out-breath is the one to focus on: the in-breath takes care of itself!</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Or you can try counted breathing. As you breathe in, count slowly up to three or four (or whatever number seems comfortable for you) and as you breathe out, count to three or four again. You might find that it's more comfortable to breathe in to a count of three and out to a count of four.</li> 
						<li class="list-group-item">Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. Keep your mouth very soft as you sigh the breath out. In through your nose, and out through your mouth. Many women also find it helpful to make a sound on the out-breath, such as "oooooooh" or "aaaaaah". In between contractions, have sips of water to prevent your mouth from becoming dry.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Support with breathing</h2>
					It can be very hard to keep your breathing rhythmical and to relax every time you breathe out when you're having painful contractions, you're tired, and labour seems to be endless. If you have a labour supporter, she can help you keep your breathing steady by breathing along with you. Physical contact helps, so make eye contact and hold hands, or ask her to put her hands on your shoulders. Follow her as she breathes in and then blows softly on your face.
					<br />
					<br />It feels strange to begin with and both of you may be rather self-conscious. However, co-breathing can be very useful when you're in labour and you think you just can't go on any more.
					<br />
					<h2 id='section5' name='section5'>Breathing and pushing</h2>
					During the second stage of labour, you will be pushing your baby out into the world. You may be told to hold your breath and push for as long as possible. Or your doctor may tell you to push just once with each contraction. If you are not told how to push, follow your urges and push as many times per contraction it feels right for you. You may find that you feel the urge to push briefly three to five times with each contraction, taking several breaths in between.
					<br />
					<h2 id='section6' name='section6'>What if I have an epidural?</h2>
					If you can't really feel when or where you are meant to be pushing, take a deep breath when your doctor tells you there is a contraction beginning, and as you blow out, let your mind travel down your body to your baby's head between your legs, and push. Some doctors recommend waiting until the baby is well down in the birth canal before you begin active pushing.
					<br />
					<h2 id='section7' name='section7'>Breathing and <i>not</i> pushing</h2>
					Sometimes women get the urge to push before their cervix is fully dilated. In this case, depending on how far dilated you are, your doctor may ask you not to push to give your cervix more time to open. This can be extremely difficult!
					<br />
					<br />Changing your position may help. If your doctor does not guide you about altering your position ask if you can lie on your side or kneel on all fours with your bottom in the air and your cheek resting on the bed. When a contraction arrives give four short pants, then a quick in-breath, followed by four more short pants and so on.
					<br />
					<br />You can also repeat the phrase "I must not push" in your head as you pant. Breathe normally between contractions.
