<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>Should I eat differently now that I am pregnant?</h2>Now that you&#39;re pregnant, it is important to <a href="diet-for-a-healthy-pregnancy.html">eat healthily</a>. Of course, this is difficult if you have morning sickness and can&#39;t seem to keep anything down. Small regular meals and a lot of fluids can help to combat the nausea you&#39;re experiencing right now.
<br/>
<br/>
When your stomach feels more settled, try to eat nutritious, well-balanced meals. If you know you haven&#39;t been eating as well as you could, pregnancy is a good time to start healthy eating habits. This will make sure you get all the nutrients you and your baby need.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Try to have a variety of the following foods each day:</b><ul><li>Fresh fruits and vegetables.</li><li>Starchy foods, such as rice, <i>roti</i>s (including mixed grain or stuffed <i>roti</i>), whole grain bread, pasta, and baked/boiled potatoes. </li><li>Foods rich in protein, such as lean meat and chicken, eggs, pulses (such as beans and lentils) and soya nuggets.</li><li>Dairy foods, such as milk, cheese, cottage cheese (<i>paneer</i>) and curd/yoghurt.</li></ul>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>How much folic acid do I need to take during my pregnancy?</h2>It&#39;s recommended that you take a daily folic acid supplement of 400mcg, when you are trying to get pregnant and for the first 12 weeks of your pregnancy.
<br/>
You need folic acid during pregnancy to help protect your unborn baby against developing neural tube defects, such as spina bifida.
<br/>
You can also get plenty of folic acid from your food. It&#39;s referred to as folate when it&#39;s in your food. Here are some excellent sources of folate:<ul><li><b>Green leafy vegetables:</b> spinach (<i>paalak</i>), fenugreek leaves (<i>methi</i>), lamb&#39;s quarters (<i>bathua</i>), mustard greens (<i>sarson</i>), radish (<i>mooli</i>) leaves, coriander (<i>hara dhania</i>), mint (<i>pudina</i>) and lettuce (<i>salad patta</i>).</li><li><b>Vegetables:</b> bitter gourd (<i>karela</i>), bottle gourd (<i>lauki</i>), apple gourd (<i>tinda</i>), lady&#39;s finger (<i>bhindi</i>), carrot (<i>gajar</i>), cauliflower (<i>phool gobhi</i>), beetroot (<i>chukandar</i>), capsicum (<i>simla mirch</i>), asparagus (<i>shatwar/sootmooli</i>), broccoli (<i>hari gobhi</i>), French beans (<i>faras been</i>), peas (<i>matar</i>), corn (<i>makai</i>), cabbage (<i>patta gobhi</i>) and brussels sprouts (<i>chhoti gobhi</i>).</li><li><b>Pulses and lentils:</b> black-eyed beans (<i>lobhia</i>), bengal gram (<i>chana</i>), soya beans, chickpeas (<i>kabuli chana</i>) and kidney beans (<i>rajma</i>).</li><li><b>Fruits:</b> muskmelon (<i>kharbuja</i>), avocado or butter fruit (<i>makhanphal</i>), pomegranate (<i>anaar</i>), guava (<i>amrood</i>), oranges (<i>narangi/santra</i>), sweet lime (<i>mausambi</i>, <i>kinnow</i>) and strawberries.</li><li><b>Fortified breakfast cereal:</b> whole wheat flakes, oats, cornflakes, wheat germ and wheat bran. Whole meal bread, whole wheat flour and whole wheat pasta.</li><li><b>Dry fruits and nuts</b>: Walnuts (<i>akhrot</i>), peanuts (<i>moongphali</i>) and almonds (<i>badaam</i>).</li></ul>We&#39;ve also got some tasty folate recipe ideas to inspire you.
<br/>
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Why am I feeling so tired?</h2>A constant feeling of fatigue is very common in the early stages of pregnancy. Being pregnant puts a strain on your entire body, which can make you feel exhausted during the day. Here are a few things to consider:
<ul><li><b>Have your hemoglobin levels checked.</b> Anaemia is a common cause of tiredness, especially if you are vegetarian.</li><li><b>Eat regular and healthy meals and snacks.</b> Having refreshing drinks like <i>nimbu pani</i> and coconut water will also help combat tiredness.</li><li><b>Go easy on the sugar.</b> Biscuits, chocolates, cakes, pastries, <i>mithai</i> and sweet drinks will only give you a short burst of energy. You may feel hungry again soon after eating them. </li><li><b>Limit your intake of caffeinated drinks.</b> They may perk you up for a while but too much caffeine could dehydrate you. The amount of caffeine recommended during pregnancy is no more than 200mg a day. Instead have nutritious drinks such as &quot;homemade&quot; lemonade (<i>nimbu pani with honey</i>), <i>aam panna</i>, <i>chach</i> or fresh orange juice.</li></ul>
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Healthy drinks and snacks during pregnancy</h2>In addition to other fluids, drink eight to ten large glasses of water a day. A refreshing alternative is a glass of chilled filtered water with a twist of lime or mint.
<br/>
Here are some other healthy drinks you could try:<ul><li>skimmed milk </li><li>coconut water</li><li>banana shake</li></ul>
<br/>
<br/>
It is best to prepare milk shakes and juices at home and drink them immediately. This reduces the risk of any spoilage or contamination. Also be careful when buying drinks from roadside vendors as it is difficult to be sure of their hygiene and freshness levels. You could also include herbal teas for variety, but make sure you get the go ahead from your <a href="how-to-choose-your-gynaecologist.html">doctor</a> first.
<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re feeling peckish and want a healthy snack, you could try these:<ul><li><i>upma</i></li><li>steamed or sautéed corn or corn (<i>chaat</i>)</li><li>mixed vegetable <i>idli</i></li><li>grilled <i>paneer tikka</i></li><li>fruit or vegetable <i>bhel puri</i></li><li><i>dhokla</i> or <i>khandvi</i></li><li>sweet potato <i>chaat</i></li></ul><br/>
Try to limit your intake of deep fried and <i>ghee</i> laden snacks. It is better to use plant oils rather than animal fat that is high in saturated fats.
<br/>
<br/>
Be guided by your appetite but beware of ‘emotional’ eating that could make you overeat at times. Contrary to popular belief, you don&#39;t need any extra calories in your first two trimesters, so don&#39;t feel that you have to try and eat for two. If you are <a href="weight-gain-in-pregnancy.html">underweight</a> your doctor or dietitian will recommend a specific meal plan for you.
