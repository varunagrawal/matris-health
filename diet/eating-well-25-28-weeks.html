				<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>How much fluid do I need during pregnancy?</h2>
				You should be drinking at least eight glasses of fluid every day, which is at least 1.5 litres.
				<br />
				<br />
				Try to make sure that water forms the main part of your daily fluid intake. Water keeps you hydrated and is important during pregnancy as it helps carry nutrients through your blood to your baby.
				<br />
				<br />
				Drinking water also helps prevent urinary tract infections (UTI), constipation and piles, all common during pregnancy. If you are suffering from water retention, remember that the more water you drink, the less water your body will retain.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>How can I get plenty of calcium and vitamin D for a healthy pregnancy?</h2>Calcium and vitamin D are key nutrients in pregnancy. Calcium helps your baby to grow strong bones and teeth. It also helps to develop a healthy nervous system, heart, and muscles. Vitamin D helps your body to absorb calcium. Vitamin D is made naturally in our bodies by exposure to sunlight. Just half an hour a day in the early morning sun is enough to get all the vitamin D you need.
				<br />
				<br />
				You can get calcium from: 
				<br />
				<br />
				<ul class ="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">dairy products</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">green vegetables such as spinach (<i>paalak</i>) and green beans (<i>faras been</i>)</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">pulses like soya bean and kidney beans (<i>rajma</i>)</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">sesame (<i>til</i>) seeds</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">almonds (<i>badaam</i>)</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				You can also get vitamin D from foods such as oily fish, eggs and milk. If you do not have enough vitamin D, your doctor will prescribe a daily supplement.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>How can I get the maximum nutrition from my food during pregnancy?</h2>
				If you are eating a <a href="diet-for-a-healthy-pregnancy.html">varied diet</a>, make sure you don&#39;t undo your hard work. For example, drinking tea or coffee at mealtimes can reduce the amount of iron your body can absorb from the food you eat. This is because these drinks contain tannins, which interfere with mineral absorption. If you want a cup of tea or coffee, wait at least 30 minutes after your meal.
				<br />
				<br />
				Eating a large amount of wholegrain foods (brown rice, wheat bran, wheat germ, multi grain bread and flour) is good for most people. However, excess helpings can reduce the amount of calcium, iron and zinc your body can absorb.Take care while preparing your food. To make the most of it, keep the following in mind:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">steaming your food in a pressure cooker or steamer helps to retain its vital nutrients</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">overcooking vegetables will make them limp and less nutritious</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">try to eat freshly prepared meals. Food loses nutrients every time you reheat it.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Healthy snacks and drinks during pregnancy</h2>Some refreshing drinks:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item"><i>thandai</i> </li>
					<li class="list-group-item">buttermilk (<i>chaach</i>)</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">date (<i>khajoor</i>) and banana shake</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				Snacks to please your taste buds:

				<br />
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">baked <i>aloo tikki</i></li>
