<h1>questions to ask your doctor in your first trimester check-ups</h1>
<div class="bodyText article" id="articleBody">
The first three months of your pregnancy are known as your &#39;first trimester&#39;. It is probably the time of the most anxiety and excitement, especially if this is your first baby. But even if you have been pregnant before, you will have many questions because each pregnancy is different.
<br/>
<br/>
The questions could be about changes (physical, mental and/or emotional) that your body will go through or about simple things like &quot;eating habits&quot; or &quot;exercise&quot;. No question is stupid and it is important you have a doctor you feel comfortable enough to talk to. If you are not happy with your doctor, or are looking for one, see our guide to <a href="how-to-choose-your-gynaecologist.html">choosing your gynaecologist</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Asking questions during your checkups is important to help you understand what to expect and to understand what is happening with you and your baby. Here is a list of possible questions for the first trimester to act as a memory jogger. You won&#39;t want to ask all of them. It&#39;s unlikely you will have time as most doctors are busy. Read through the ones that interest you and then decide if there are more questions you want to ask your doctor.
