<h1>questions to ask your doctor in your third trimester check-ups</h1>
<div class="bodyText article" id="articleBody">
You have reached the final phase of your pregnancy, the third trimester. You may find your excitement growing as you get closer to seeing your baby but also you might be a bit scared about labour and birth. Such mixed emotions are absolutely normal.
<br/>
<br/>
You are most likely to have a visit scheduled with your doctor every two weeks from 28 to 36 weeks of pregnancy, then switch to once-a-week visits until you have your baby.
<br/>
<br/>
Asking questions during your checkups is important to help you understand what to expect and to help you understand what you and your baby are going through. Here is a list of possible questions for the third trimester to act as a memory jogger. You won&#39;t want to ask all of them. It&#39;s unlikely you will have time as most doctors are busy. Read through the ones that interest you and then decide if there are more questions you want to ask your doctor.
