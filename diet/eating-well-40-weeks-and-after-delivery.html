				<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>Can I eat and drink during labour?</h2>
				Yes. You can eat and drink during early labour as long as you:
				<br />
				<br />
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">haven&#39;t been given a pain killer such as pethidine.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">You can eat so long as you don&#39;t have any complications that might make you need a general anaesthetic</li>
				</ul>
				Eat what you feel like eating, within reason! Carbohydrates are better than most foods for labour. This is because they release energy slowly to help you through contractions. Here are some suggestions:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">baked potatoes</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">toast</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">bananas</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">dried fruit</li>
				</ul>
				To quench your thirst, you could try lemon honey water, coconut water or fresh fruit juice. Read more about eating and drinking during labour.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Should I eat differently when I start breastfeeding my baby?</h2>You can eat anything you like as long as it is in moderation. Research has shown that a breastfeeding mother requires anywhere between 300 and 500 extra calories a day. Your body will get some energy from fat stored in your body during pregnancy as well.
				<br />
				<br />
				However, it is important to eat healthily when you are breastfeeding. It&#39;ll help you to <a href="diet-for-healthy-weight-loss.html">lose any extra weight</a> you may have added during pregnancy and give you the much needed energy.
				<br />
				<br />
				Try to include these foods in your diet:
				<br />
				<br />
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">vegetables</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">nuts</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">fruit</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">fish</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">poultry</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">whole grains</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">toned or double toned milk</li>
				</ul>
				You can get very thirsty when your body is making breastmilk. So drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.
				<br />
				<br />
				Elders may insist you have traditional foods and drinks, specifically made for lactating mothers such as <i>panjiri</i> or dry fruit <i>laddoos</i> to enrich the quality of breastmilk.
				<br />
				It may be difficult to refuse these during the first 40 days after your baby&#39;s birth. So if you can, eat these calorie rich foods in small quantities and include wholesome fruits and vegetables in your diet. Also try including drumsticks, roasted cumin (<i>jeera</i>) seeds and brinjal (<i>baingan</i>) in your diet. These are traditionally believed to help with low milk supply.
				<br />
				<br />
				If you are formula-feeding you may not need as many calories. Still, it is important that you eat a varied diet. This will help you recover from birth and cope with your new role.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Are there any foods that will help me recover from birth?</h2>Traditionally new mums are given &quot;heating foods&quot; to speed up recovery after birth. These foods are believed to be packed with vitamins and minerals that help build your strength and keep your energy levels up. Some of these foods are high in calories as they have a generous helping of <i>ghee</i> and sugar. And although you do need the extra calories, overeating may result in unwanted weight gain.
				<br />
				<br />
				It&#39;s best to stick to small portions to enjoy these traditional delicacies. You could also use nutrient rich ingredients to make healthier foods after your delivery. For example, drink carom seed (<i>ajwain</i>) water instead of eating <i>ajwain paranthas</i> with <i>ghee</i>. This way you&#39;ll get the benefits of <i>ajwain</i> without the extra calories.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Healthy snacks and drinks during pregnancy</h2>Suggestions for healthy drinks:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">fresh ginger lemonade</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">saffron or cashew (<i>kaju</i>) milk </li>
					<li class="list-group-item">coconut water</li>
				</ul>
				Try these tasty treats for some much needed energy:
				<br/><br/>
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">roasted <i>channa</i> chaat </li>
					<li class="list-group-item">grilled mushrooms</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">baked <i>samosa</i></li>
					<li class="list-group-item">soya nugget salad</li>
