<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>How much weight should I gain during pregnancy?</h2>It&#39;s best to gain weight gradually. You&#39;ll probably put on between 10kg and 12.5kg during your whole pregnancy.
<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that <a href="weight-gain-in-pregnancy.html">weight gain during pregnancy</a> varies among women. So it is best to concentrate on eating healthily. A well balanced diet includes plenty of carbohydrates, fruits and vegetables, protein, and dairy foods. And just a little in the way of healthy fats and jaggery, honey and brown sugar.
<br/>
<br/>
You may not have put on much weight during the first trimester, but your weight should steadily increase during the <a href="/a1044044/questions-to-ask-your-doctor-in-your-second-trimester-check-ups">second trimester</a> as your baby grows.
<br/>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Why do I need omega 3 fatty acids, now that I&#39;m pregnant?</h2>Omega 3 fatty acids are important in pregnancy for your baby&#39;s brain and eye development. Oily fish such as mackerel (<i>bangda</i>) and herring (<i>bhing</i>) and sardines (<i>pedvey machli</i>) are good sources.
<br/>
<br/>
When choosing oily fish, bear in mind that they may contain some environmental pollutants, such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and dioxins. So it&#39;s best that you don&#39;t have more than two portions a week. Also, try and have the smaller sized fish as opposed to the large fish that tend to accumulate more mercury.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>If you&#39;re a vegetarian, you can get omega 3 fatty acids from foods such as:</b><ul><li>tofu</li><li>soya beans</li><li>walnuts (<i>akhrot</i>)</li><li>leafy green vegetables</li><li>eggs</li><li>milk</li><li>sesame seeds (<i>til</i>)</li></ul><br/>
You could try a supplement derived from algae or a fish oil supplement especially formulated for pregnant women. However, it is safest to speak to your doctor before taking any supplement.
<br/>
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Why do I need to focus on my iodine intake during pregnancy?</h2>By around week 14, your baby&#39;s thyroid gland starts to function and begins to make its own hormones. The thyroid gland needs iodine to work properly.
<br/>
<br/>
Seafood such as fish, shellfish and seaweed are the richest sources of iodine. If you eat fish, cook some of these at least twice a week:<ul><li>haddock</li><li>mackerel (<i>bangda</i>)</li><li>prawns (<i>jhingra</i>)</li><li>salmon (<i>raawas</i>)</li><li>sardines (<i>pedvey</i>)</li></ul><br/>
The best natural sources of iodine are cereals, pulses and fresh foods. Other sources of iodine include:<ul><li>iodised salt</li><li>dairy products such as cheese, <i>paneer</i>, butter and curd/yoghurt</li><li>vegetables like mushrooms (<i>khumbi</i>), onions and spinach (<i>paalak</i>)</li><li>meat </li><li>eggs</li></ul>
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Healthy snacks and drinks during pregnancy</h2>Choose from these delicious drinks:<ul><li><i>rasam</i></li><li>black plum (<i>kala jamun</i>) smoothie</li><li><i>apple and date smoothie</i></li></ul><br/>
Try these great snack ideas:<ul><li>whole wheat pasta and vegetable salad</li><li>homemade fruit yogurt</li><li><i>uttapam</i></li><li><i>jowar methi dhebra</i></li><li>corn <i>chaat</i></li><li><i>paneer tikka</i></li><li>soya <i>kababs</i></li></ul>.
