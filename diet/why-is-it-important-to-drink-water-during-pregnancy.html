<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>Why is it important to drink water during pregnancy?</h2>
Pregnant or not, you need water to keep healthy. Your body and your vital organs must have water to function properly.
<br/>
<br/>During  pregnancy, your body needs more water to cope with the demands of your changing body. Water is essential for healthy blood cells and to keep your body hydrated. Water is also a key component of breastmilk, and essential for good lactation.
<br/>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>What are the benefits of drinking water?</h2>
You need water to keep your body hydrated. Drinking enough water prevents  dehydration. Dehydration during pregnancy can lead to many complications such as  headaches,  nausea,  cramps,  oedema and dizziness. This is especially important in the third trimester when dehydration can actually cause contractions that can trigger  preterm labour.
<br/>
<br/>The best way to tell if you are dehydrated is to check the colour of your urine. It should be pale or straw-coloured. If it is dark you need to drink more water.
<br/>
<br/>Some women find that drinking water regularly helps relieve symptoms of morning sickness, acidity and heartburn as well as indigestion. It also helps in  keeping your body cool and maintaining your temperature, especially in the hot and humid months.
<br/>
<br/>Water also helps prevent  urinary infections, which are common during pregnancy. If you drink enough water, your urine will be dilute, reducing your risk of infection.
<br/>
<br/>It also eases constipation, haemorrhoids, oedema and water retention. Although you may not think so, the more water you drink during pregnancy, the less water your body will retain.
<br/>
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>How much water should I drink while I'm pregnant?</h2>
You need to drink about three litres (ten to twelve glasses) of fluid every day. For every hour of <a href="../exercise/exercises-recommended-throughout-pregnancy">light exercise</a> you do, add another glass of water. During the summer, you will need to drink even more to make up for the fluid you lose because of perspiration.
<br/>
<br/>Juices can count as part of your fluid intake, but remember they can also contain a lot of extra calories. Caffeinated beverages, such as  coffee, colas and teas shouldn't be counted as part of your fluid intake because they're diuretics. Diuretics make you urinate more so you actually lose water.
<br/>
<br/>If you're not sure how much water you drink each day, fill three one litre bottles of water and try to finish them by the end of the day.
<br/>
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>I don't like the taste of water so how do I make sure my body gets the fluids it needs?</h2>
If you don't like drinking water, try adding a wedge of lemon or lime, and allow them to infuse for a while. You could also add other things, like a washed sprig of mint or a little juice for extra flavour. This can be a welcome change, especially if you are feeling nauseous. Adding fresh coriander, grated ginger, fennel seeds <i>(saunf)</i> or a cardamom <i> (elaichi)</i> pod also gives an interesting twist.
<br/>
<br/>You can also make a plain glass of water more refreshing by adding frozen fruit such as orange, lemon, kiwi, peach, apricot and plum instead of ice cubes. The frozen fruit looks colourful floating about in the clear water and it chills your drink, giving it a hint of fruity flavour.
<br/>
<br/>Try and drink plenty of non-caffeinated fluids, such as tender coconut water, fresh lime water, <i>lassi</i>, buttermilk, milk shakes and homemade <i>jal jeera</i> and <i>aam panna</i>.
<br/>
<h2 id='section5' name='section5'>How can I ensure the water I drink is safe and clean?</h2>
To prevent the risks of waterborne diseases you need to make sure you only drink filtered, bottled or boiled water. Unfiltered or unboiled water may carry a host of contaminants, bacteria and viruses. These are a health risk and may cause serious infections.
<br/>
<br/>If you're going out, carry your own water, so that you are sure it is clean and safe. If you buy packaged water, make sure the bottle is sealed. Always check the 'date of packaging' and the 'best before' date before you buy. Do not buy bottles that are damaged, leaking, discoloured, have broken seals or sediment at the bottom.
<br/>
<br/>If you are eating out, always ask for branded, sealed, bottled water and have it opened at your table. If you prefer cold water, ask for a chilled, sealed bottle of water instead of ice cubes. The ice may have contaminants if it has been sourced from a local vendor without a hygienic facility. Also there is no way to know if the ice has been made with filtered water. Sodas and carbonated water are more likely to aggravate acidity and heartburn, so it's best to give them a miss.
<br/>
<br/>Keep having small amounts of water throughout the day. Every little bit of water helps ensure a healthy pregnancy.
