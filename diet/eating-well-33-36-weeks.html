<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>What can I do about acidity and indigestion during pregnancy?</h2>Many pregnant women experience acidity or heartburn and indigestion. This happens because of the hormonal and physical changes happening in your body during pregnancy.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are suffering, try to cut out:<ul><li>rich, fatty and spicy foods</li> <li>chocolate</li><li>citrus fruits</li><li>coffee</li></ul><br/>
Have small, frequent meals, and take your time over your meals. Eat slowly, have small mouthfuls and chew your food well. To ease bloating, sit up straight while you&#39;re eating, and don&#39;t lie down for at least two and a half hours after a meal.
<br/>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Do I need to take vitamin K during pregnancy?</h2>It may be helpful to have vitamin K now and during the first weeks with your baby, particularly if you are breastfeeding. The first breastfeeds of colostrum are rich in vitamin K.
<br/>
<br/>
All babies are given vitamin K when they are born to help their blood to clot. This is because babies can bruise and bleed easily if they are born with low levels of vitamin K. Check with your doctor for more details.
<br/>
<br/>
You can make sure you get plenty of vitamin K from foods such as:<ul><li> green leafy vegetables like spinach (<i>paalak</i>), fenugreek (<i>methi</i>), lamb&#39;s quarters (<i>bathua</i>) and mustard greens (<i>sarson</i>)</li><li>cantaloupe melon (<i>kharbooja</i>)</li><li>cauliflower (<i>gobhi</i>)</li> <li>green beans (<i>faras bean</i>)</li><li>wholemeal bread </li></ul>
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Can I go on a diet during pregnancy?</h2>No, it isn&#39;t safe to go on a diet when you are pregnant. Dieting could be harmful for both you and your unborn baby. Some diets can leave you low on iron, folic acid and other important vitamins and minerals.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of thinking about a diet, use these nine months to develop good eating habits. This will carry you through the rest of your life and help you lose your post pregnancy weight safely.
<br/>
<br/>
A varied diet, rich in fruit and vegetables, will also help to further develop your baby&#39;s immune system.
<br/>
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Healthy snacks and drinks during pregnancy</h2>Make one of these brilliant drinks for yourself:<ul><li>fruit punch</li><li>alcohol-free vegetable mocktail</li><li>tomato and mint juice</li></ul><br/>
Treat yourself to one of these healthy snacks:<ul><li>baked <i>sabudaana vadai</i> </li><li> apple <i>kheer</i></li><li>cabbage (<i>patta gobhi</i>) and <i>moong dal</i> salad </li><li>popcorn</li></ul>
