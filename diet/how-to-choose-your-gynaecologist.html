Visiting a gynaecologist should be a part of every woman&#39;s medical routine. Finding the right gynaecologist may take some time, but it&#39;s worth doing your research and choosing someone you feel comfortable with. After all, your gynaecologist will be the one helping you through your pregnancy and delivery so it is important to feel that you can speak to him or her freely. Here are a few tips to help you make your choice:
<br/>
<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>Does the gynaecologist have a good reputation?</h2>There is nothing wrong in being particular about your standards when it comes to your gynaecologist. After all, your gynaecologist is privy to some of the most intimate facets of your sexuality, body and overall health. Start with the website of the hospital he or she is affiliated to. This should tell you about the doctor&#39;s medical credentials and for how long they have been practising. It may highlight their particular areas of interest or experience as well. See if the gynaecologist is also an obstetrician. If she isn&#39;t you will need to see a different doctor at the time of your delivery because only obstetricians are qualified to deliver babies.
<br/>
<br/>
You can also ask around among your friends, family, colleagues or your own general physician. You are bound to find someone who goes to that particular gynaecologist and if not, you will probably hear of a good gynaecologist you might want to consider.
<br/>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>What should I ask the gynaecologist?</h2>When you go for your first &quot;introductory&quot; appointment, you may want to ask yourself the following questions:
<br/>
<ul><li>Does the gynaecologist <a href="questions-to-ask-your-doctor-in-your-first-trimester-check-ups.html">answer your questions</a> willingly and accurately?
</li><li>Is she friendly and responsive?
</li><li>Do you feel comfortable asking her personal medical questions?
</li><li>Does she seem up to date?
</li><li>Is she listening to your concerns and answering accordingly?
</li><li>Is she gentle during her check-up?
</li><li>Does she seem to care about your comfort?
</li></ul>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t feel a rapport building with this doctor, try another one.
<br/>
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>How easy is it to meet the gynaecologist?</h2>Good doctors are always busy, but you don&#39;t want a doctor who always seems too busy to take her time with you or to speak to you. Most doctors are willing to give you their cell phone number or email addresses. Find out how this gynaecologist deals with emergency calls. Ask how quickly she aims to get back to people with non emergency queries. Check out how long you would usually have to wait for routine appointments, and how quickly you could be seen if you were unwell.
<br/>
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>How far is the gynaecologist from your home?</h2>Think about the distance you need to travel for your appointments with your gynaecologist. Do you want one close to home or would it be easier to visit someone close to your work? Think about how you will get there. If you need to use public transport check out how easy it will be. If you are pregnant or thinking of starting a family, you might find it easier to have a doctor closer to home since you will be going for more frequent check-ups.
<br/>
<h2 id='section5' name='section5'>Do you prefer a female gynaecologist?</h2> Many women prefer female gynaecologists. But keep an open mind: you may also find a male gynaecologist who is understanding and helpful. Make your decision after you have had a chance to speak with several doctors.
<br/>
<h2 id='section6' name='section6'>Will your insurance cover the cost of your doctor&#39;s visits?</h2>Check your finances. There are some insurance schemes that do not cover visits to the gynaecologist. In this case you may need to compare visiting costs. Delivery charges also vary a lot between gynaecologists and often insurance schemes have a limit on the extent to which they cover you. If you have a baby planned or on the way, it may be worth comparing the delivery charges of the gynaecologists on your list.
<br/>
<h2 id='section7' name='section7'>How do you <i>feel</i> about the gynaecologist?</h2> There is a reason that a women&#39;s intuition is so revered, it is often right! So do your researches, check background information, schedule an appointment and meet the gynaecologist, but in the end trust your gut.
<br/>
<br/>
Often family members have a common gynaecologist because it is easier to see someone known, tried and tested than to look for a new doctor. Do not feel bad about wanting someone else if for some reason you are not comfortable with the gynaecologists that your other family members have been happy with. It is about your health and your body so <b>you</b> have to be satisfied.
