				<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>How can I eat properly if I have morning sickness?</h2>If you have morning sickness, you may not have much of an appetite at the moment. Try having small, regular meals and plenty of drinks. This may help to ease your nausea and keep your energy up if you’re feeling very tired.
				<br />
				<br />
				Nausea is not only unpleasant, but it can be tricky to deal with if you have not yet gone public about your pregnancy. Although it is often called morning sickness, nausea can occur at any time of the day.
				<br />
				<br />
				<b>Here are some tips to help you with morning sickness:</b>
				<br/><br/>
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">Keep biscuits (or cream crackers) by your bed and nibble one or two before getting up from your bed in the morning. This can be repeated every time you lie down during the day as well.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">When you feel sick, sip a ginger-based drink, such as ginger tea (<i>adrak ki chai</i>), ginger ale or a cup of hot water with a slice of fresh ginger and lemon. You could also chew on a small piece of fresh or dried ginger as and when you feel nauseous.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">Eat small, mildly flavored snacks between meals, such as <i>poha</i> or plain <i>khakara</i>.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">If the smell of food makes you feel worse, ask a family member to take over in the kitchen for sometime, till you feel more settled. You could also hire a cook to help you during this period.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">Sniff freshly cut lemons, fresh coriander or mint. Choose the one which works for you. You can also add some slices of lemon or fresh mint to iced tea or sparkling water.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">Try these natural remedies to cope with morning sickness.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				If you can&#39;t keep any food or liquids down for more than a day, see your doctor. Excessive vomiting should be brought to your doctor&#39;s notice at the earliest.
				<br />
				<br />
				Do keep in mind that you don&#39;t have to worry about eating for two. Most women don&#39;t need any extra calories until the third trimester, when an extra 300 calories a day are recommended. That adds up to just one slice of cheese with 2 slices of bread, two <i>idlis</i> with chutney or a large serving of <i>upma</i> or <i>poha</i>.
				<br />
				<br />
				However, depending on your weight and activity levels you may need to eat less or more than usual. Speak to your doctor or dietitian to work out a diet plan suited to your specific needs.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Are B vitamins important during pregnancy?</h2>Vitamin B6 may help with morning sickness. It also helps your body to use and store energy from your food and produce red blood cells. Many foods are excellent sources of vitamin B6, such as bananas, brown rice, lean meats, poultry, fish, avocados, whole grains, corn, and nuts.
				<br />
				<br />
				Vitamin B12 is also an important nutrient in pregnancy. You only need small amounts of this vitamin to keep you healthy. But if you have very low levels, you can develop anaemia or even damage your nervous system.
				<br />
				<br />
				If you eat meat or dairy products then you&#39;re unlikely to be lacking in vitamin B12. If you are a vegan, you will either need to include plenty of foods that are fortified with vitamin B12, or take a supplement. Some brands of soya milk, some breakfast cereals and yeast extract are fortified with vitamin B12.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Why is magnesium important for a pregnant mum?</h2>Magnesium is important in pregnancy for the proper growth of your baby&#39;s bones. It is also essential for your muscle health, including your uterus. Magnesium helps to make and repair tissue in your body as well.
				<br />
				<br />
				Aim to include these magnesium-rich foods in your diet:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">salad greens</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">nuts</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">soya beans</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">whole grains</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">seeds of pumpkin, melon (<i>magaz</i>) and sunflower (<i>surajmukhi ke beej</i>)</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				Traces of magnesium are also found in:
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item"><b>Dried fruits</b>, especially figs (<i>anjeer</i>), apricots (<i>khubaani</i>) and raisins (<i>kishmish</i>).</li>
					<li class="list-group-item"><b>Green leafy vegetables</b> such as spinach (<i>paalak</i>), radish leaves (<i>mooli ka saag</i>), lamb&#39;s quarters (<i>bathua</i>), mustard greens (<i>sarson</i>), fenugreek leaves (<i>methi</i>) and lettuce (<i>salad patta</i>).</li>
					<li class="list-group-item"><b>Vegetables</b> such as bottle gourd (<i>lauki/doodhi</i>), bitter gourd (<i>karela</i>), peas (<i>matar</i>) and sweet corn (<i>makai</i>).</li>
					<li class="list-group-item"><b>Non-refined cereals</b> such as whole-wheatand brown rice.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item"><b>Pulses</b> such as green gram (<i>moong dal</i>) and kidney beans (<i>rajma</i>).</li>
					<li class="list-group-item"><b>Dairy products</b> such as milk, cottage cheese (<i>paneer</i>) and curd/yoghurt.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item"><b>Non-vegetarian foods</b> such as fish, poultry and meat.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				The placenta helps to keep a check on the magnesium reaching your baby. So don&#39;t worry about taking in more than you need.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Healthy snacks and drinks during pregnancy</h2>These drinks may help make your morning sickness more bearable:
				<br/><br/>
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item"><i>aam panna</i></li>
					<li class="list-group-item">homemade <i>jal jeera</i></li>
					<li class="list-group-item">lemonade (<i>nimbu pani)</i></li>
					<li class="list-group-item">homemade tomato soup</li>
					<li class="list-group-item"> ginger tea (<i>adrak chai</i>)</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				These nutritious snacks may be easier to keep down than other foods during your <a href="/a1044041/questions-to-ask-your-doctor-in-your-first-trimester-check-ups">first trimester</a>:
				<br/><br/>
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">whole grain crackers</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">rusks</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">cucumber <i>raita</i></li>
					<li class="list-group-item">banana <i>chaat</i></li>
					<li class="list-group-item">baked <i>papad</i> with <i>rasam</i></li>
				</ul>
