If your job keeps you on your toes, it can be hard taking out time to eat well during pregnancy. If you are suffering from morning sickness or aversions to food, it can be even harder. Here are a few suggestions to stay energised and give your unborn baby the nutrients he needs.
<br/>
<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>What can I eat during my commute to and from work?</h2>It&#39;s a good idea to take a healthy snack with you if you have a long commute via public transport, or a long car journey. If you are in too much of a rush in the morning, make something the night before. The important thing is that you don&#39;t go without breakfast.
<br/>
<br/>Try to eat a few of these as snacks each day on your way to work:<ul><li>Fruits such as bananas (<i>kela</i>), apples (<i>seb</i>), oranges (<i>santara</i>) or pears (<i>nashpati</i>)</li><li> <i>paneer parantha </i> </li> <li><i>idlis</i></li> <li><i>dhokla</i></li><li> vegetable <i>upma</i> </li></ul>You&#39;re advised to have no more than 200mg of caffeine a day during pregnancy. This includes caffeine in tea, coffee, soft drinks, energy drinks and chocolate. So supersized cups of tea may not be the best way to wake you up in the morning. Instead try taking fruit smoothies, milkshakes or fruit juice.
<br/>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>How can I make sure I get a good lunch at work?</h2>If you can, take your lunch into work so you can make sure you have a <a href="diet-for-a-healthy-pregnancy.html">balanced meal</a>. Inspiration often runs out when it comes to lunch options and your preparation time may be limited. Here are some healthy and quick options:
<br/><ul> <li><b>Sandwiches</b>. Use whole wheat brown bread or multi grain bread. These breads will release energy to your body more slowly than white bread. Other interesting alternatives are pitta bread, tortillas and ciabatta. Add different salad leaves, such as lettuce or grated cabbage (<i>patta gobhi</i>), carrot (<i>gajar</i>), pine nuts (<i>chilgoza</i>) and bean sprouts. If finding enough preparation time in the morning is a problem, prepare some fillings for the sandwiches at the weekend. Try coriander (<i> dhaniya</i>) or mint (<i>pudina</i>) chutney to make quick sandwich spreads.</li><li><b>Paranthas</b>. The options are unlimited here. You can opt for a stuffing of fenugreek (<i>methi</i>), spinach (<i>paalak</i>), mustard greens (<i>sarson</i>), cooked lentils (<i>dal</i>) or mince (<i>keema</i>) for your paranthas. With a bowl of curd, your meal is complete.</li><li><b>Rice</b>. You can try a variety of fried rice, vegetable <i>pulaos</i>, curd or lemon rice as lunch options. Combine this with a bowl of salad and <i>raita</i> or curd and you have a tasty meal at hand. </li><li><b>Baked or boiled potatoes</b>. A good filler, potatoes provide energy, vitamin C and fibre. Carry a couple of boiled potatoes and a lime for an instant <i>chaat</i>. Or mix them with puffed rice(<i>murmure</i>) and add onions (<i>pyaaz</i>), tomatoes (<i>tamatar</i>), raw mango (<i>ambi</i>), peanuts, green chillies (<i>hari mirch</i>), coriander (<i>dhania</i>) and a dash of lime to make a filling <i>bhelpuri</i>.</li><li> <b>Salads</b>. Whether you make your own or buy them ready-made, choose a salad containing a variety of different ingredients and ensure they are really fresh. Salads containing grains, pasta and couscous release energy slowly. This will keep you feeling full for a longer time. You can add chicken breast or eggs to give you protein. </li><li> <b>Drinks</b>. Have a glass of fresh coconut water, buttermilk, lemonade (<i>nimbu pani</i>) or <i>lassi</i>. </li></ul>
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>I have to eat out often, what are healthy options?</h2>If you eat out very often, here are a few tips to help you choose good options for you and your baby:
<br/><ul><li>The occasional <i>bread pakora</i> or burger is fine, but fast food can be high in fat and salt so don&#39;t make it a regular part of your diet. </li><li>Make sure you know which foods are not safe for you to eat during pregnancy</li><li>Be careful about food and drinks which have curd, raw vegetables, water or ice. During pregnancy, you are more vulnerable to catching infections so it is best to eat only at places with good hygiene levels</li><li>Make sure you vary your nutrients from day to day. Even though you might have found one place you like going to, try different dishes so you are sure of getting a variety of nutrients.</li><li>It is better to have smaller more frequent meals than three big meals a day. So eat well and satisfy your hunger but you do not need to eat for two. Instead, keep a variety of healthy snacks in your desk drawer to nibble on when you get hungry between meals.</li></ul>
