<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>How can I get enough vitamins for a healthy pregnancy?</h2>You can get plenty of vitamins from fresh fruits and vegetables. Try to eat five portions of a variety of fruits and vegetables every day. Eat raw vegetables or steam them instead of boiling them. This will help you to make the most of the vitamins vegetables contain.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are worried about your diet, speak to your doctor about taking a pregnancy multivitamin. But remember that no supplement can be a good enough substitute for healthy food.
<br/>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Why is iron important during pregnancy?</h2> You need plenty of iron every day during pregnancy because it helps you to make red blood cells for your growing baby. You can also become anaemic if you don&#39;t have enough iron. Try to have plenty of foods rich in iron, such as lean red meat, poultry and fish. Your body can absorb iron most effectively from non-vegetarian sources.
<br/>
<br/>
You can also get iron from vegetarian sources such as lentils, pulses, spinach (<i>paalak</i>), and iron-fortified breakfast cereals. But your body canâ€™t take in as much iron from these foods. If you include a source of vitamin C at the same time, such as glass of orange juice or <i>nimbu pani</i>, this will help your body to better absorb the iron.
<br/>
<br/>
Cooking in iron utensils can also contribute to improving the iron content of the food.
<br/>
<br/>
Black tea and coffee can interfere with the absorption of iron, so it&#39;s best not to have these drinks with or soon after your meals.
<br/>
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>How can I have a healthy vegetarian diet during pregnancy?</h2>If you are vegetarian, you should take extra care to ensure you have plenty of iron and calcium. Good sources of iron for vegetarians include fortified breakfast cereals, tofu, wholegrain bread, dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, pulses, soya and soya products and dried fruits such as raisins, dates and figs.
<br/>
You can get calcium from dairy products, chickpeas (<i>chana</i>), kidney beans (<i>rajma</i>) and baked beans, sesame seeds (<i>til</i>), almonds (<i>badaam</i>) and fortified soya products.
<br/>
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Healthy snacks and drinks during pregnancy</h2>These drinks are packed with vitamins and minerals that you need for a healthy pregnancy:<ul><li>fresh sapota (<i>chikoo</i>) or mango smoothie</li> <li>freshly squeezed pomegranate (<i>anaar</i>) juice</li><li><i>lassi</i></li></ul>
<br/>
Here are some nourishing and tasty snacks for you to try:<ul><li>porridge made from different cereals such as finger millet (<i>ragi</i>), oats (<i>jai</i>) or cracked wheat (<i>dalia</i>)</li><li><i>dhokla</i></li><li>wheat noodles with vegetables</li><li>rice pancake (<i>appam</i>)</li></ul>
