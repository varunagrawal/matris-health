				<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>How can I eat healthily in the first week or two with my baby?</h2>Once you and your baby come home you may have much less time to get anything done, let alone cook. Eating well is even more important now. This is because your body needs nutrients to recover and provide breastmilk for your baby. Having a steady supply of healthy meals will give you one less thing to worry about.
				<br />
				<br />
				New mums who live in joint families or move to their parents&#39; house for the delivery of their child are more likely to follow traditional confinement practices. Different communities have different customs, but generally, the new mother is supposed to rest and do a minimum of house work. Family members usually cook special traditional foods during confinement and most new mums find this period of pampering a welcome relief.
				<br />
				<br />
				If confinement is not for you, then it&#39;s best to get your kitchen duties organised before your baby comes home. Family members and friends who are keen to help can take turns to cook for you till you&#39;ve recovered. Or you may prefer to hire a cook or a maid till you feel ready to prepare meals yourself.
				<br />
				<br />
				Some new mums prefer to freeze batches of food and use them for the first couple of weeks after their baby arrives. This way there&#39;s always something homemade and healthy to defrost or heat up without the worry of cooking from scratch. But, be cautious about freezing food if there are frequent power cuts in your area. Some also choose to order food from reputed restaurants, caterers or a tiffin service. So explore all options before your baby&#39;s birth.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Are there any foods that can bring on labour?</h2>If your pregnancy goes beyond 40 weeks, it is considered overdue. You&#39;ll usually be offered an induction during or after 40 weeks. So, if your induction date is looming, there are things you can try to hurry up the waiting game. Although we can&#39;t guarantee that any of them work!
				<br />
				<br />
				You could try eating a spicy curry to bring on labour. But bear in mind that spicy foods can cause heartburn and acidity. And if you&#39;re not used to spicy food it may irritate your bowel, leaving you with an upset stomach.
				<br />
				<br />
				Fresh pineapple is another option. It contains the enzyme bromelain which is thought to help soften the cervix. One pineapple contains very small amounts though, so you would have to eat at least seven for it to have any effect!
				<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>What kind of food should I be eating and taking to the hospital?</h2>With your baby&#39;s birth fast approaching, try to organise snacks and drinks to take into the hospital. For some women, eating is the last thing on their mind. But for others, particularly those who have a long first stage, a snack may be essential.
				<br />
				<br />
				<b>Try these suggestions:</b>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">If you feel like it, have a light meal during the early stages of labour before you go into hospital.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">Take some easy-to-digest snacks in case you do feel hungry in the early stages. Plain biscuits, rusks, nuts and raisins are ideal.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">Check in advance what the hospital canteen has to offer. If the food on their menu does not seem interesting, you could enlist the help of some relatives to organise snacks or a packed meal for your husband or birth partner.</li>
				</ul>
				If you become over-tired during the birth, the hospital may provide a fluid drip to give you energy.
				<br />
				However, do check with your doctor and hospital if you can bring your own snacks and drinks. Some <a href="choosing-your-maternity-hospital.html">hospitals</a> have a policy where only snacks and drinks from the hospital canteen are allowed.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Healthy snacks and drinks at 37-40 weeks</h2>Drinks you may like to try:

					<li class="list-group-item">fresh fruit juice</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">mango smoothies</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">tomato apple juice</li>
				</ul>
				Snacks to cater to your cravings:
				<br/>

					<li class="list-group-item">baked banana chips</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">vegetable <i>thepla</i></li>
