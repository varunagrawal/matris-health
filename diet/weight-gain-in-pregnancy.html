				<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>How much weight should I put on during pregnancy?</h2> It&#39;s quite normal to put on weight during pregnancy! Your body is growing and changing to give your baby the best start in life. Here&#39;s where the extra weight comes from:<ul> <li> At birth, the average baby weighs anywhere between 2.8 and 3.3kg.</li> <li> During pregnancy, the muscle layer of your womb (uterus) grows dramatically and weighs an extra 0.9kg.</li> <li> The placenta, which nourishes your baby, weighs just over 0.5kg.</li> <li> Your breasts weigh an extra 0.4kg.</li> <li> Your blood volume increases and weighs an extra 1.2kg.</li> <li> You have extra fluid in your body, and amniotic fluid around the baby, weighing around 2.6kg.</li> <li> You will also lay down some fat during your pregnancy to provide you with extra energy for breastfeeding. This comes to about 2.5kg.</li> </ul> <br />
				So, by the end of your pregnancy you might weigh about 10.5 - 11kg more than you did before you became pregnant. This is an average weight gain but of course, you&#39;re not an average woman. And no woman is. Our  pregnancy weight gain estimator can give you a more personalised indication of what you might gain. The amount of weight you should gain will depend on how heavy you were before you became pregnant. Or more accurately, on what your  body mass index (BMI) was (see below).<br />
				<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Will I be weighed in pregnancy?</h2>Yes, you will be weighed at every doctor&#39;s visit. Your doctor will be checking to see that you put on weight gradually. If you put on a lot of weight all of a sudden, it could be a sign of pre-eclampsia. Your weight gain will also give an indication of whether you are eating enough. Though it can give some indication of your baby&#39;s growth, a better measure is your weight gain in relation to your BMI <i> before</i> you became pregnant. It&#39;s recommended that your doctor calculates your BMI when you have your  first prenatal appointment.<br />
				<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Calculating your body mass index (BMI)</h2> To calculate your BMI, your doctor needs to know how tall you are in metres and how heavy you are in kilograms. If you would like to have a go at doing it yourself, here&#39;s how:<br />
				<br />
				<b> 1.</b> Multiply your height in metres by your height in metres. For example 1.6 by 1.6 metres gives you 2.56.<br />
				<b> 2.</b> Then divide your weight in kg by this figure. So, if you weigh 60 kg, your BMI will be 60 divided by 2.56 = 23.43.<br />
				You can also calculate your BMI using our  BMI calculator.<br />
				Here&#39;s how to classify your BMI:<br />
				<b> BMI less than 18.5</b> - underweight<br />
				<b> BMI 18.5 to 22.9</b> - ideal<br />
				<b> BMI equal to or more than 23</b> - overweight<br />
				<b> BMI equal to or more than 25</b> - obese<br />
				<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Your BMI and pregnancy weight gain</h2> Experts now recommend that women should aim for a weight gain related to their pre-pregnancy BMI:<ul> <li> If your BMI was less than 19.8, you should aim for a weight gain of between 12.5 and 18kg.</li> <li> If your BMI was between 19.8 and 26, you should aim for a weight gain of 11.5 to 16kg.</li> <li> If your BMI was above 26, you should aim for a weight gain of 7 to 11.5kg.</li> </ul> <br />
				If you are under 20 years of age, you should aim for a weight gain at the top end of the range for someone with your pre-pregnancy BMI.<br />
				<h2 id='section5' name='section5'>What if I&#39;m overweight and pregnant?</h2> Women with a high BMI before pregnancy should try to limit the amount of weight they gain. Putting on a lot more weight could increase your risk of developing:
				<ul> <li>  high blood pressure </li> <li>  gestational diabetes </li> <li> backache</li> <li> leg pains and  varicose veins </li> <li> increased fatigue</li> <li> having a  big baby </li> </ul> <br />
				Don&#39;t try to diet, though. Research shows that for a pregnant women who is overweight, or who has put on a lot of weight in the first half of pregnancy, a low-calorie diet does not reduce the chances of developing  high blood pressure or  pre-eclampsia. Such a diet won&#39;t help your baby either. Instead, get some advice from your doctor about how to eat a  sensible, nourishing diet. This will make sure you don&#39;t pile on the kilos, but still keep you and your baby happy and healthy. It&#39;s much better to stick to a normal, well-balanced diet and just cut out things like colas, <i>namkeens</i>, biscuits, cakes, <i>mithai</i> and ice-cream, which aren&#39;t very nutritious.<br />
				<h2 id='section6' name='section6'>What if I&#39;m underweight and pregnant?</h2>If you are underweight, it is best to try to put some weight on before you become pregnant. Being underweight can make it harder to conceive. (Read more on  weight and fertility.) If you do become pregnant, you might have a small baby. Small babies can sometimes have lots of problems.<br />
				<br />
				If you are already pregnant, but underweight talk to your doctor. She will recommend the best diet for you and your baby.<br />
				<h2 id='section7' name='section7'>What if I&#39;m diabetic and pregnant?</h2> If you are  diabetic, it&#39;s especially important that you should start pregnancy with a healthy BMI. If you&#39;re reading this <i> before</i> you get pregnant, go and see your doctor and check out your diet. If you are already pregnant, you will need to take extra care to keep your blood sugar level stable, so ask your doctor to suggest the best possible diet to keep you and your baby healthy. Most doctors can recommend dieticians who can devise special meal plans for diabetic women in pregnancy. (Read more on  diabetes and pregnancy.)<br />
				<h2 id='section8' name='section8'>Breast cancer and pregnancy weight gain</h2> In 2002, the American Association for Cancer Research reported a study showing that women who put on a lot of weight during pregnancy and don&#39;t lose it again afterwards are at increased risk of developing breast cancer after menopause. Experts recommend that women should pay attention to their lifestyle during pregnancy, especially to taking <a href="../exercise/exercises-recommended-throughout-pregnancy"> regular exercise</a>. It&#39;s a good idea to try and lose any excess &quot;baby weight&quot; after having your baby, especially before the menopause. For advice on how to do this, see our  new mum&#39;s guide to a healthy weight loss.<br />
				<h2 id='section9' name='section9'>Controlling your weight during pregnancy</h2> All you really need to do is to eat sensibly, bearing in mind that a pregnant woman needs about 2,500 calories a day. A sensible diet includes five portions of fruit and vegetables each day, and foods from all the major food groups:<ul> <li> Proteins: about 10 per cent of your calories should come from proteins, such as meat, fish, eggs and pulses.</li> <li> Dairy products: about 35 per cent of your calories should come from dairy products like butter, milk, <i>paneer</i> and cheese, and from oils and nuts (fats), slightly less if you are overweight. Low-fat spreads and curd are fine.</li> <li> Carbohydrates: about 55 per cent of your calories (the largest part) should come from <i>chapattis</i>, rice, bread, pasta, potatoes and cereals (carbohydrates). Wholewheat products are better than refined white flour (<i>maida)</i>, as they will keep your blood sugar steady and you will feel fuller for longer.</li> </ul> <br />
				There&#39;s no harm in having the occasional chocolate or ice-cream treat, but remember that the extra weight you put on during pregnancy will show all too clearly after your baby is born and losing weight in the early months of motherhood isn&#39;t going to be easy.<br />
