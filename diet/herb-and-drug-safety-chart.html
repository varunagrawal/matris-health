Herbal remedies are considered natural alternatives to certain drugs, but they can also be dangerous when taken during pregnancy. While a cup of chamomile tea is perfectly safe for a mum-to-be, many herbs contain chemicals that can cross the placenta to your baby, and some can cause premature contractions.
<br/>
<br/>
As with all medications, you should avoid taking any herb during the first trimester and use only minimal amounts for short periods of time thereafter, and then only when needed. If you wish to use herbs to treat a problem (rather than to ease symptoms of minor conditions such as heartburn), see a qualified herbalist. And always talk to your obstetrician or midwife before taking any herb or medicine during pregnancy.
