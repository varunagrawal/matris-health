			<h1>questions to ask your doctor in your second trimester check-ups</h1>
			<div class="bodyText article" id="articleBody">
				The middle three months of pregnancy are known as your &#39;second trimester&#39;. By now, you and your doctor have probably established a good rapport and you will have had at least 3 visits at different intervals.<br />
				<br />
				Asking questions during your checkups is important to help you understand what to expect and to understand what is happening to you and your baby. No question is stupid so ask as many as time permits. Here is a list of possible questions for the second trimester to act as a memory jogger. You won&#39;t want to ask all of them. It&#39;s unlikely you will have time as most doctors are busy. Read through the ones that interest you and then decide if there are more questions you want to ask your doctor.<br />

				<ul>
					<li>
						What tests do I need to take during this time? <br />
					</li>
					<li>
						Will I have another ultrasound?<br />
					</li>
