<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>How can I ease constipation during pregnancy?</h2>You can ease constipation by eating plenty of high-fibre foods such as:<ul><li>oats (<i>jai</i>) and cracked wheat (<i>dalia</i>)</li><li>wholegrain bread</li><li>whole wheat <i>rotis</i></li><li>dried fruit and nuts</li><li>fresh fruits and vegetables</li></ul><br/>
It is important to drink lots of water with a fibre-rich diet. Fibre absorbs water and not having enough water may worsen the constipation. Some mums relieve constipation by using natural remedies such as eating figs (<i>anjeer</i>) and psyllium seeds (<i>isabgol</i>).<br/>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Is vitamin A important during pregnancy?</h2>You need vitamin A during pregnancy both for your sake and your baby’s. Vitamin A is essential for night vision, cell growth, healthy skin and red blood cell production. Vitamin A exists in our food in two forms: retinol and beta carotene. Both forms are good for your health and your developing baby’s. <br/>
<br/>
Retinol is present in egg yolk, butter, margarine and milk, all of which are good to eat during pregnancy. Liver products have retinol as well but in too high doses. So it is better not to eat liver or liver products during pregnancy.<br/>
<br/>
Good sources of betacarotene are:<ul><li>carrots (<i>gajar</i>)</li><li>sweet potatoes (<i>shakarkandi</i>)</li><li>papaya (choose ripe ones)</li><li>oranges (<i>santra/narangi</i>)</li><li>green vegetables, especially broccoli (<i>hari gobhi</i>) and spinach (<i>paalak</i>)</li></ul><h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Why is cholesterol important for my pregnancy?</h2>Cholesterol is vital for keeping your placenta healthy. Some experts say that low levels of cholesterol may lead to premature labour. This could result in a low birth weight baby.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a blood test  at this stage of your pregnancy, it might show your cholesterol levels are higher than usual. A slight increase from normal levels is usually nothing to worry about. Your cholesterol level increases slightly during this stage because it is needed in the production of many hormones. <br/>
<br/>
Unless your <a href="how-to-choose-your-gynaecologist.html">doctor</a> advises otherwise, don’t try to change your cholesterol levels during pregnancy by medication or by eating foods that claim to reduce it. <br/>
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Healthy snacks and drinks during pregnancy</h2>Here are some flavoursome drinks for you to choose from:<ul><li>beetroot (<i>chukandar</i>) and carrot (<i>gajar</i>) juice </li><li>fig (<i>anjeer</i>) and apricot (<i>zardaloo/khoobani</i>) shake </li><li>watermelon (<i>turbooj</i>) juice</li></ul><br/>
These snacks may help to ease constipation during pregnancy:<ul><li>steamed sprout salad </li><li>curd rice</li><li>soya granule <i>tikki</i></li><li>stuffed millet (<i>bajra</i>) <i>roti</i>s </li></ul><br/>
