				Being prepared for your doctor's appointment can help you make the most of the time you get with your doctor and the money you spend on the visit. Take a little time to think about how you want to handle your appointments.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>What can I do to be physically comfortable for my visit?</h2>
				<b>Practice good personal hygiene:</b> Take a shower, and wear clothes that are easy to get dressed and undressed in. You may need a physical examination or you may have tests such as a pap smear.
				<br />
				<br /><b>Carry your medical records:</b> Remember to take your medical records. They are an excellent reference point for your doctor. You can organize them chronologically and put them in a folder to carry easily.
				<br />
				<br /><b>Wear comfortable clothing:</b> Many doctor's offices have a first come-first serve policy so you may have to wait longer than you would expect. Even if you have fixed a time for your appointment, situations could arise where you may have to hang around longer that you thought. It helps to dress in clothes and shoes that you feel comfortable in, such as loose fitted <i>kurtas</i> or tops, draw-string pants, slacks, flat shoes and so on.
				<br />
				<br /><b>Pack some food and beverages:</b> Carry a snack, just in case the long wait makes you feel hungry. Especially if you are going out in the summer, make sure to always carry water with you. If you go outside to grab a snack from the cafeteria ask the receptionist if she can call your cell phone number so you don't miss your appointment.
				<br />
				<br /><b>Take some entertainment:</b> Take a book, magazine, your knitting or anything that helps you pass the time. If you have younger children there may be times that you may have to take them with you to the doctor's clinic. To keep them busy pack their books, crayons or video games.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>How can I be mentally prepared for my doctor's visit?</h2>
				<b>Research:</b> Read up in advance on any issue you are worried about. It will help you understand many of the answers your doctor gives you and will make it easier to ask questions.
				<br />
				<br /><b>Write a list of questions:</b> Before your appointment think about all the questions and concerns you have about your health and write them down. Put the most important questions at the top of your list. You may only get a chance to ask one or two if your doctor is busy that day. You will find a list of the most common concerns pregnant women have in our guide on <a href="questions-to-ask-your-doctor-in-your-first-trimester-check-ups.html">first</a>, <a href="questions-to-ask-your-doctor-in-your-second-trimester-check-ups.html">second</a> and <a href="questions-to-ask-your-doctor-in-your-third-trimester-check-ups.html">third trimester</a> questions to ask your doctor.
				<br />
				<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>What can I do to make my visit an emotionally good experience?</h2>
				<b>Take someone with you:</b> You will feel more at ease if you go with someone you trust and who can hold your hand if you feel worried. Bring along your husband, mother, sister, or friend. If you want to speak about personal or intimate concerns then make sure you pick someone you are comfortable speaking to about these issues.
				<br />
				<br /><b>Be Honest:</b> Always be honest with your doctor about your health and medical background. Frank answers about your family health history, lifestyle choices with respect to alcohol, smoking or drugs, sexual habits, eating preferences or exercise routine will help your doctor provide you with the right treatment.
				<br />
				<br /><b>Address all issues:</b> Even if you feel embarrassed, address all your concerns with your doctor from any physical discomfort you may have to any emotional mood swings you may be going through. If you find it hard, start by saying that you find this embarrassing. It will signal to your doctor that you need to say something intimate, and warn her to give you time to speak.
