<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>Do I need to eat more in my last trimester?</h2>Now that you&#39;re in your <a href="questions-to-ask-your-doctor-in-your-third-trimester-check-ups.html">last trimester</a>, your energy requirement increases as your baby&#39;s growth speeds up.
<br/>
<br/>
This means you will need to start having an extra 200 to 350 calories a day, depending on your weight. But it doesn&#39;t mean you can eat for two! 350 calories is equal to about:<ul><li>two <i>roti</i>s with a <i>katori</i> of <i>sabzi</i> </li><li>two <i>idlis</i> with a small bowl of <i>sambar</i></li></ul>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Is it fine if I skip meals during pregnancy?</h2>No, it isn&#39;t. Don&#39;t miss any meals as you and your baby need to eat well for a regular supply of energy. And being on an empty stomach for too long may cause acidity and heartburn.
<br/>
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>What can I eat when I&#39;m feeling hot during pregnancy?</h2>During pregnancy your metabolic rate increases by around 20 per cent. This means that, even when you&#39;re resting, your body will feel much hotter than usual. This may make you more uncomfortable than usual during the hot summer months. If the weather is hot and humid, you might feel exhausted because of all the fluids and salts you sweat out.
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you drink more water to replace all the fluids you are losing through sweat. Have as much coconut water, <i>lassi</i>, fresh lime water (<i>nimbu pani</i>), and aam panna as you can handle. Try our healthy and alcohol-free drink ideas if you are looking for more options. Remember to drink water before leaving the house and always carry boiled or adequately treated water with you.
<br/>
<br/>
If the heat affects your appetite, try to eat little but often. Here are some options you could try:<ul><li>A cooling side-dish to accompany your main course such as a <i>raita</i>, pineapple and cottage cheese salad or freshly cut cucumber salads.</li><li>Making a meal of a cooling dish like curd-rice with cucumber or cold pasta salad.</li><li>Having freshly cut fruit from the fridge in between meals. Juicy fruits like watermelon (<i>tarbooj</i>), pomegranate (<i>anaar</i>) or cantaloupe melon (<i>kharbooja</i>) are ideal, as they are easy to digest and are packed with minerals.</li><li>Snacking on fruit yoghurts or fruit <i>chaat.</i></li><li>Fresh mint leaves are refreshing and can be added to fruit salads, <i>nimbu pani</i>, <i>aam panna</i>, chutneys, <i>biryani</i>s or even just a glass of chilled milk.</li></ul>
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Healthy snacks and drinks during pregnancy</h2>Take your pick from these excellent thirst quenchers:<ul><li> almond (<i>badaam</i>) milk </li><li>grape (<i>angoor</i>) sherbet</li><li>apple and carrot juice</li></ul>Satisfy your hunger pangs with these yummy snacks:<ul><li><i>bajra methi khakhra</i>s</li><li>baked spinach (<i>paalak</i>) and cheese rolls</li><li> <i>appam</i> with fresh coconut chutney</li><li>stir fried chicken or vegetables</li></ul>
