If you have to work night shifts in your job and are planning to be working throughout your pregnancy, keep the rest of your life as simple and as healthy as possible.
<br/>
<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>Eat right, sleep tight</h2>
Use your weekends well to catch up on your sleep and stock your refrigerator. Always keep fruits and healthy frozen vegetables handy. Most of the frozen vegetables available are easy to prepare and also very nutritious. Puddings and custards are healthy snacks. You can prepare them over the weekend and store them in the refrigerator for a couple of days together.
<br/>
<br/>Your snack cupboard should also be well-stocked with healthy snacks such as roasted chickpeas, protein and glucose biscuits, nuts, and juices. You can also store <i>lassi</i> and milk in tetra packs. Choose the ones you like and stock them up for a week.
<br/>
<br/>If you are in the habit of sleeping during the day, ensure that you nap well in the afternoons even over your weekends. This will help you make up for your sleep that you might otherwise miss out on during the week. Sometimes, during pregnancy your regular sleep habits get affected and you might find it difficult to sleep well. Consult your gynaecologist in case of any anxiety that you may have about not having enough sleep.
<br/>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Get moving</h2>
Exercise well; it will help you eat, sleep, and work well. Develop a daily routine of walks and simple exercises. Squeeze in a little bit of yoga, aerobics, and other pre-natal exercises as well. Enrol yourself in pilates exercise classes for the weekend. Even when you are in the middle of work take short breaks to stretch a bit and walk around every couple of hours. Use the workplace aisle or the wide corridor optimally for the purpose.
<br/>
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Maintain a comfortable posture</h2>
If your job involves sitting at the computer, ensure that your posture is correct and doesn&#39;t strain your back. As your pregnancy progresses, a firm seat and back cushions might help you cope. If you notice that your legs and feet swell up after sitting for the long hours together, keep a small plastic stool under your desk.Set a timer or an alarm as a reminder to stretch your legs every 30 minutes or so.
<br/>
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Practice relaxation techniques</h2>
De-stress as much and as often as you can. A good way is to close your eyes and take deep breaths. This will help you keep the pregnancy aches and fatigue at bay to a large extent. Meditation and relaxation techniques are useful in calming down. (Remember to avoid nausea triggers and stay away from people who are unwell.)
<br/>
<h2 id='section5' name='section5'>Make your health a priority</h2>
Take the medicines prescribed by your gynaecologist regularly. Regular intake of the prescribed multi-vitamin, iron and folic acid, and calcium pills, along with a nutritious diet and plenty fluids of will help you stay healthy and productive on the job. Do not miss your antenatal appointments - speak to your doctor if you feel you are under undue pressure or not able to cope. Always keep your doctor&#39;s number and your husband&#39;s number handy in case of any emergency.
<br/>
<h2 id='section6' name='section6'>Keep superiors informed</h2>
Establish expectations right at the beginning of your pregnancy, especially at work. Speak to your boss about your pregnancy and discuss ways in which you could add value to the team, while taking it easy on the hours and the volume of work. Prepare your immediate senior for the extra leaves that you might need to take. Also, let him know that you will deeply appreciate a little bit of flexibility -- on days you might need to come in to office late or maybe leave early. Use your leaves to catch up on your sleep, if and when necessary. Remember, your immediate supervisor&#39;s response will in a very big way affect your next few months at work, so try and work out a way that is mutually agreeable and beneficial.
<br/>
<h2 id='section7' name='section7'>Redo your routine</h2>
It is important to go into your pregnancy knowing that things are going to change in your life drastically. If you are going to be working throughout, ensure that you are giving ample time to your relationship. Spend time with your husband, and talk and discuss things that may be nagging you. Don&#39;t fret if you aren&#39;t able to finish your household chores or are unable to do all the things that you were before getting pregnant. Ask for help freely and willingly when things seem too much to handle. You will be surprised to know how many people are only too glad to lend you a helping hand!
