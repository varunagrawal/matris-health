					A lot of research has been carried out in the West on whether sitting in front of a computer all day causes birth defects or miscarriage -- and the studies indicate that there&#39;s no evidence that it does.
					<br/>
					<br/>					Of course, sitting anywhere for hours on end won&#39;t do you any good, so get up and <a href="../exercise/walking.html">walk</a> around every few hours.
					<br/>
					<br/>					If your job involves sitting long hours at the computer, ensure that your posture is correct and doesnâ€™t strain your back. As far as possible, choose a chair which is straight backed and gives adequate support. Try using a cushion or foam wedge to support the small of your back. Keeping a low stool to elevate your feet is also a good idea as is changing your position frequently. Set a timer or an alarm as a reminder to stretch your legs every 30 minutes or so. This also relieves eye strain caused by constantly focusing on a screen.
					<br/>
					<br/>					If using a laptop, always keep it on a worktable at a convenient height and not on your lap since it radiates a lot of heat. Connect an external mouse to your laptop if it has a toggle or touch pad since these options may strain the wrist muscles and tendons. Likewise the keyboard of a computer should be ergonomically placed so as to minimise strain.
