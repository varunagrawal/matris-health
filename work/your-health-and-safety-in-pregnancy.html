<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>Is there any reason I shouldn't work while I'm pregnant?</h2>
If you're having a low-risk, normal pregnancy, you can certainly continue working. However, if you have been specifically advised by your doctor to rest for a particular period due to medical reasons, then it is best that you follow her advice. Other than that, there are certain health and safety aspects that you may need to consider to make your workplace safe for you and your unborn baby.
<br/>
<br/>The <a href="maternity-leave-and-the-law.html">Maternity Benefits Act</a>, 1961 prohibits an employer to knowingly employ a woman for six weeks after delivery, and also protects against her being made to do arduous work or work that involves standing for long hours in the two and a half months preceding her due date, which might pose a risk to her health or the baby’s health.
<br/>
<br/>If your organisation is in an industry which poses a risk due to the specific work conditions (say an automobile factory which has a high concentration of chemicals in certain areas) or due to the nature of your job (say a sales job that involves a lot of travel, working long hours, and high levels of stress), do consult your doctor to understand the risks involved. Also read your company HR manual carefully or discuss the issue with the HR department in case they already have a policy in place. Your co workers who have been through the same experience may also be a good source of information.
<br/>
<br/>It is important that you review the factors connected with your job and work environment, which might pose a risk to your health or the baby’s health. Commuting, work related stress, travel, working hours and domestic pressures -- all these can strain your health. If you are confident that these can be managed and adjustments made for your pregnancy, then there is no reason why you cannot continue to work.
<br/>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>What can I do to take care of myself while I am pregnant at work?</h2>Health and safety issues are not just about obvious physical problems, but also things like mental and physical fatigue, movements and postures, travelling, and noise, all of which might affect your overall well being.
<br/>
<br/>Even if your job requires minimal standing and nothing more risky than lifting a telephone, you may find some simple measures will make you feel more comfortable. You could try:
<br/>
<ul><li>Taking breaks. Put your feet up if you've been standing, or stand and walk around every two hours if you've been sitting. This will help decrease swelling in your feet and ankles, and it should keep you more comfortable. Throw in a few stretching exercises to protect your back.
</li><br/>
<li>Resting when you can. The more strenuous your job, the more you may want to reduce physical activity outside work.
</li><br/>
<li>Wearing comfortable shoes and loose clothing.
</li><br/>
<li>Taking time to eat regular meals. Choose snacks and lunches that are balanced and nutritious. Add fibre to your diet to ease constipation. Avoid drinking coffee or other diuretics in large quantities. </li></ul>
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Can I work right up to my due date?
<br/></h2>You are legally allowed to work for as long as you want -- it is your choice when to start maternity leave. The earliest that you can go on maternity leave, as per the law, is six weeks before your due date.
<br/>
<br/>Towards the end of your pregnancy, you may find yourself feeling tired very quickly, so take it as easy as possible. Some companies, especially in the IT industry, allow women to work from home in the last months of pregnancy depending on the nature of their job. While working right upto your due date, gives you more time at home with your baby after she arrives, taking off a week or two before your due date can give you time to rest, prepare, and indulge yourself.
<br/>
<br/>Remember that this may be the last quality time you have for yourself for a long time to come.
<br/>
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Are jobs that require a lot of physical activity dangerous?
<br/></h2> If your job involves physically strenuous work, your employer is prohibited from knowingly making you do such work two and a half months before your due date. If you have a strenuous job and it is taking a toll even during the early stages of your pregnancy, talk to your doctor about it.
<br/>
<br/>If your doctor thinks you must reduce your activities, explore other options with your employer which will enable you to continue working, albeit in a different area. The HR department of your organization may also be able to offer you a workable solution. While you may think of your job as being sedentary, do take note of tasks like carrying heavy files and climbing up and down stairs several times a day which might also strain your body. These tasks could be temporarily handled by a colleague in concurrence with your employer.
<br/>
<h2 id='section5' name='section5'>Is there any risk associated with working at a computer?
<br/></h2>There's no evidence that <a href="is-it-safe-to-be-around-computers-all-day-when-im-pregnant.html">working at a computer</a> causes any harm to your developing baby.
<br/>
<h2 id='section6' name='section6'>If I have any possible pregnancy complications, should I stop working?
<br/></h2>Talk it over with your doctor, as it will depend on your condition. But you may be advised to stop if you've previously given birth to more than one premature baby, have either diabetes or high blood pressure, have a history of miscarriage, or are expecting twins. If you have a low lying placenta (placenta praevia), you might be advised total bed rest for a certain period depending on the stage of your pregnancy and other related conditions.
