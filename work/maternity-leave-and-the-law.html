<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>I&#39;m pregnant and working full time. How much leave can I expect to get from my employer?</h2>
HR policies for pregnant women vary from company to company. Check with the HR department of your company to find out more about its policy on maternity leave. A good HR policy should ensure that you receive maternity as well as other health benefits, including group medical insurance that covers your whole family.
<br/>
<br/>According to the Maternity Benefits Act 1961, you are entitled to 6 weeks of leave before your due date, and 6 weeks after your child&#39;s birth. So you can claim at least 12 weeks or three months maternity leave. If your company&#39;s HR policy is more generous, you might be lucky enough to get even six months off.
<br/>
<br/>If you have a miscarriage or an abortion, you are entitled to 6 weeks leave by law.
<br/>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>What maternity benefits am I entitled to?</h2>
Under the Maternity Benefits Act of 1961, you&#39;re entitled to maternity benefits at the rate of your average daily wage for the period of your absence, for a maximum period of 12 weeks (6 weeks before delivery and 6 weeks after). You can only claim this compensation though if you have worked at least 80 days for your employer in the last 12 months.
<br/>
<br/>The average daily wage means the average of your wages during the three month period immediately before your maternity leave starts.
<br/>
<br/>If you miscarry, you are entitled to six weeks of leave and wages.
<br/>
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Can my employer dismiss me because I&#39;m pregnant?</h2> It is unlawful for your employer to dismiss you from work because you are pregnant or suffer from any illness during pregnancy. Most companies have policies preventing discrimination against pregnant women, but there have been cases of subtle discrimination where women have been pressurised into giving up work. If you feel your employer is not applying the law properly, take legal advice.
<br/>
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>How do I claim maternity leave?</h2> This depends on the HR policy of your company. According to the Maternity Benefits Act of 1961, you are required to give your employer notice in writing asking for the maternity leave and benefit. You will have to specify that you will not be working during the time you receive the benefit.
<br/>
<br/>If you take six weeks off before your delivery, the law entitles you to the corresponding wages before you deliver if you give proof of being pregnant. The wages corresponding to the six weeks of maternity leave after your delivery should be given once you give proof of having delivered.
<br/>
<h2 id='section5' name='section5'>What other benefits am I entitled to?</h2> Many companies also offer health insurance benefits and other medical allowances. You can discuss these in detail with your HR department.
<br/>
<br/>In the chance that you need it, the law allows for up to a month of sick leave if the illness or problem requiring leave is because of your pregnancy, delivery or premature birth. During this month, you are entitled to your usual wage. But you will need to submit proof of the illness.
<br/>
<br/>The law also states that from 10 weeks before your due date, you will not have to do arduous work, stand for long hours or be asked to do any other work that may cause problems.
<br/>
<h2 id='section6' name='section6'>How can I get maternity insurance?</h2> Most insurance companies don&#39;t cover pregnancy because maternity is not an unexpected risk. However, your employer may have a group insurance policy. Most group insurances cover hospital charges up to a fixed amount and pre- and post-delivery hospital stay for up to 60 days. Some insurance companies also cover the pre- and post-delivery charges. They don&#39;t cover routine monthly check-ups and medical termination within 12 weeks of pregnancy. You can only claim maternity insurance if you&#39;ve been in the group insurance scheme for at least nine months.
<br/>
<br/>If you are not covered by a group insurance, you can avail of a family insurance provided by many insurance companies. However, most of these insurance schemes require that you are with them for at least 24 months before the pregnancy, and have paid three premiums.
