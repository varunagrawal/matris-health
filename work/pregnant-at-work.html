					<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>Is there any reason why I shouldn&#39;t work while pregnant?</h2>
					If you&#39;re having a low-risk, normal pregnancy and work in a safe environment, you can certainly continue working. Health and safety regulations are in place to protect new and expectant mothers and their babies in the workplace, and employers are expected to be aware of, and if necessary remove, any risks or hazards that may affect you.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you feel that you are being exposed to <a href="your-health-and-safety-in-pregnancy.html">any risk</a> as a result of your employment (this could be because of the materials that you are exposed to, or excessive travelling, or shift work, for example) then you should talk to your human resources department or trade union representative. See <a href="maternity-leave-and-the-law.html">Your rights during pregnancy and early parenthood</a> for more information.
					<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>How do I manage morning sickness at work?</h2>
					Sixty to 90 per cent of women experience some degree of nausea or morning sickness during pregnancy. The chances are that you could be affected at work as well as at home. If you know that you are prone to vomiting, rather than just feeling nauseous, keep wipes and mouthwash in your car. If you haven&#39;t told the office your news yet, you could come up with a few convincing lines about &quot;food poisoning&quot;. However, you may find that your colleagues will put two and two together as they gather evidence that will point towards your pregnancy, such as lengthy periods in the loo or your sudden disinterest in alcohol!
					<br />
					<br />
					If you are suffering particularly severe and prolonged morning sickness, you may have to tell your boss about your pregnancy earlier than planned.
					<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>How can I remain professional as my pregnancy progresses?</h2>
					Fortunately, it is now easy to get hold of business maternity wear - either in the shops, through mail order or online. You will always be able to look smart and professional, even as your pregnancy reaches its final stages.
					<br />
					<br />
					During the first and third trimesters, you may experience tiredness, absent-mindedness, and daydreaming; during the second, you will probably feel more energetic and focused. It may help you to talk to a colleague who has been through this too, who knows how it feels and can support you.
					<br />
					<br />
					Your pregnancy, though visible, can still be private. There is likely to be a lot of interest in it from colleagues as well as friends. Some women welcome this, enjoying the opportunity to talk about their growing baby. Others prefer their pregnancy to be part of their personal life, and not for discussion at work. You may have to be a little tolerant at first if people want to discuss it more than you would like. However, you can make it clear by the way you handle comments when you would like to close the subject. Remember, too, that the novelty of the pregnancy will soon wear off and interest will diminish very quickly.
					<br />
					<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>How can I best take care of myself while working?</h2>
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">Put your feet up. Keep a box or stool under your desk.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Wear comfortable shoes. You might try maternity or support tights, too.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Dress comfortably.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Seek out the support of fellow mothers.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Take breaks. Stand up and stretch if you&#39;ve been sitting; sit down and raise your feet if you&#39;ve been standing.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Drink a lot. Keep a tall water glass at your desk, and refill it often. (This will also give you a chance to take a break.)</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Evaluate your office space. <a href="is-it-safe-to-use-a-computer-or-laptop-during-pregnancy.html">Working at a computer</a> won&#39;t harm your developing baby, but pregnant women are more susceptible to carpal tunnel syndrome (numb, achy fingers), so be sure to take any steps you can to make your desk and chair arrangement as comfortable as possible.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Rest, rest, rest. Don&#39;t over-exert yourself at home or at work.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Eat properly. Avoid the workplace diet of constant coffee.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Avoid workplace hazards.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Reduce stress. If you can&#39;t eliminate a stress factor in your workplace, try to find ways to manage it, such as deep-breathing exercises, yoga, stretching, or simply taking <a href="../exercise/walking.html">a short walk</a>.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">Accept help. If your colleagues want to baby you a little, and you don&#39;t mind, then let them. Consider yourself lucky to be in a supportive environment. This is a rare and special time in your life and it would be a shame to have to pretend that nothing is different. Make the most of it!</li>
