<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>How will pregnancy affect my back and pelvis?</h2>Pregnancy is likely to change the way your back looks and behaves. If you stand sideways in front of a mirror, you may see that you have a natural curve at the bottom of your back. As your belly grows, this may become more pronounced, making you feel as though you are leaning back more.
<br/>
<br/>Not all women have this curve. Instead, you may find your back becomes flatter during pregnancy, particularly if you are not carrying your baby &quot;all at the front&quot;.
<br/>
<br/>If you have a bad back, it&#39;s unlikely to be because of the changes caused by pregnancy to your posture. It&#39;s more to do with how your muscles have to adapt to your changing body. The muscles of your back, belly and pelvic floor are designed to move and support the joints of your back and pelvis. As your uterus (womb) grows, it can become harder for them to do this job, and you may feel some back pain.
<br/>
<br/>Your back is vulnerable to the same stresses and strains as someone who isn&#39;t pregnant. However, it&#39;s slightly protected by your baby acting as an internal support. But this will also make you less flexible. As your baby grows, you will notice your back feeling stiffer, and you&#39;ll find it harder to bend forwards and twist round.
<br/>
<br/>Your pelvis isn&#39;t protected in the same way as your back, and moves more. It is affected by the pregnancy hormones oestrogen and relaxin. These make the tough, flexible tissues that connect your bones (ligaments) more stretchy. This is one reason why pelvic pain is more common than back pain during pregnancy.
<br/>
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>How can I protect my back and pelvis during pregnancy?</h2><b>Try not to do any heavy lifting</b>
<br/>If you have to lift or carry anything, hold it close to your body. Bend your knees rather than your back (as if squatting) and try not to twist. If you have a toddler, see if she can climb onto a chair or stool before you pick her up. Encourage your toddler to climb into her bed, car seat or high chair by herself or by just holding your hand.
<br/>
<br/><b>Exercise regularly</b>
<br/>Exercise is <a href="the-benefits-of-staying-active-during-pregnancy.html">good for you</a>, as long as you don&#39;t overdo things. If something hurts when you exercise and you push through the pain it will only make things worse. Keeping fit and flexible through gentle exercise can help you avoid getting a bad back. Unfortunately, you can&#39;t protect your pelvic joints in the same way.
<br/>
<br/>The best forms of pregnancy exercise include swimming, walking, using an exercise bike, pilates or yoga. Read our tips on <a href="tips-for-a-safe-workout.html">exercising safely</a>.
<br/>
<br/>Your doctor may know of any classes for pregnant women in your area. It is important that any exercise instructor is qualified to teach exercise to pregnant women.
<br/>
<br/><b>Wear comfortable shoes</b>
<br/>You may be most comfortable in flat shoes, or you may need a bit of a heel to take the pressure off your back. It&#39;s hard to say whether wearing heels makes you arch your back or not. So just wear what feels best. If you are used to very high heels and swap to shoes with no heels, you may feel uncomfortable at first. However, you may find your muscles will slowly adjust to the difference.
<br/>
<br/><b>Improve your posture</b>
<br/>When standing, imagine that someone is making you taller by pulling a string attached to the top and back of your head. Tightening your pelvic floor muscles and your tummy muscles will help to support your back in this posture.
<br/>
<br/>Doing an exercise called pelvic tilting can ease back strain caused by sitting or standing for long periods. When sitting, slowly work your pelvis back and forth, making your back round and then arched. Do these actions rhythmically without moving your shoulders. Try to make this exercise a habit before any pain comes on. If you have pelvic pain, focus on the forward tilt, as this helps your pelvis.
<br/>
<br/><b>Get into a good sitting position.</b>
<br/>Make sure that your back is well supported when you&#39;re sitting down. Ideally, your back should be slightly arched with your breasts pointing straight ahead rather than down towards your bump. This is easier if you part your legs slightly so that your bump has somewhere to go! You could use a cushioned support which fits over the back of your chair.
<br/>
<br/>Sitting upright in a dining chair will help your back more than lounging in a soft chair or sofa. If you have to sit for long periods , get up and walk around every 20 minutes.
<br/>
<br/><b>Try getting on your hands and knees</b>
<br/>This is an excellent position for reducing pressure from the weight of your baby on your back. You can do this several times a day when you get a moment alone or in your room. When you are on all fours, round your back up into a bump, tucking your tailbone underneath you. Then gently arch your back in the opposite direction so that you stick your bottom out. Repeat this in a rocking motion to help with your back or pelvic pain.
<br/>
<br/>To strengthen your lower tummy, try this exercise: While on all fours, try and keep your back straight (so neither arched, nor curved in a bump). Hold your back still, breathe in, and do a pelvic floor squeeze. At the same time, pull your belly button in and up. Hold this for five to 10 seconds, while breathing normally and keeping your back still.
<br/>
<br/><b>Sleep easy</b>
<br/>After 16 weeks of pregnancy, lying on your back can make you breathless or faint. That&#39;s because your baby is pressing on your blood vessels. Try lying on your left, with your knees bent up and two or more pillows placed between your knees. This keeps the pressure off the muscles around your hips and pelvis.
<br/>
<br/>Placing a wedge-shaped pillow under your bump can ease back pain. You can also place a rolled-up towel under your waist. A c-shaped maternity pillow will do the same job.
