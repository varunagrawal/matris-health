Going for a jog is the quickest and most efficient way to work your heart and body. Also, you can tailor it to your schedule – running 15 minutes one day when that&#39;s all you have time for and a half hour the next when your schedule permits it. However, it&#39;s not for you if you&#39;ve never worked out before you became pregnant. Whether you&#39;re pregnant or not, running can be hard on the knees. And during pregnancy, your body produces the hormone relaxin, which loosens your joints, making you even more prone to injury. So unless you&#39;re an avid runner, you should probably steer clear of this workout – at least until the baby arrives. Pregnancy is not the time to start. Stick to walking or any other activity deemed safe for pregnant women. Jogging and running can place considerable pressure on your pelvic floor, so remember to perform your pelvic floor exercises while you jog – a few exercises before and after won&#39;t be enough.

Follow the usual precautions, such as monitoring your heart rate and drinking lots of water before, during, and after a jog. If you don&#39;t, you can get dehydrated, which can decrease blood flow to the uterus and may even cause premature contractions. Avoid running in hot and humid weather. Overheating, especially in the first trimester, is potentially harmful to your baby, so you need to avoid overheating during exercise. Also, wear proper shoes that provide plenty of support for your feet.

Your centre of gravity is shifting, and your abdomen is growing larger, leaving you vulnerable to slips and falls. For safety, stick to flat pavements. If you do lose your balance, try to fall correctly – sideways or onto your hands and knees, and not directly onto your abdomen.

Be as careful as you&#39;ve been in the first two trimesters. Remember, if you feel too tired to go for a run, listen to your body and take a break. While being sedentary is unhealthy for you, pushing yourself too hard is also harmful.

<br/>For those women used to jogging and running, there is no reason why you can&#39;t continue to enjoy a favourite pastime. You will find yourself tapering off the distance, time and intensity of your workout as the pregnancy advances. Listen to your body and watch out for any signs of danger.
