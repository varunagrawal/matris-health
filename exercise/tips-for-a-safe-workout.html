Medical experts can&#39;t say enough good things about exercising during pregnancy, as long as it&#39;s moderate and doesn&#39;t put you at risk of slips and falls. Activities such as <a href="swimming.html">swimming</a>, <a href="walking.html">walking</a>, and low-impact aerobics are good choices.
<br/>
<br/>Even if you&#39;re normally quite supple, relaxin, a hormone which relaxes the pelvic joints in preparation for childbirth, also loosens all ligaments and joints, making you more susceptible to sprains and other injuries. That&#39;s why it&#39;s doubly important to pick the right activity.
<br/>
<br/>If you&#39;re committed to keeping fit, do so on a regular basis. It&#39;s best to exercise at least three times a week. Working out sporadically can put you at risk of injury; plus, you don&#39;t <a href="pregnancy-exercise-guide.html">benefit from exercise</a> by working out only once in a while.
<br/>
<br/>Other tips:
<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>Check with your doctor or midwife before starting an exercise programme</h2>
If you have always been active, you can probably continue your exercise regime while you&#39;re pregnant, providing your pregnancy isn&#39;t considered high risk. That said, it can&#39;t hurt to check with your doctor or midwife to make sure the activities you participate in are right for you. Also, if you&#39;ve never been the athletic type, they can give you some helpful tips for getting started.
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Wear loose-fitting, breathable clothing and supportive shoes</h2>
To avoid <a href="avoid-overheating-during-exercise.html">overheating</a> while you exercise, layer clothes so they&#39;re easy to remove or wear outfits specially designed for exercise. Although there&#39;s no proof of a danger to humans, some animal studies suggest that overheating can cause birth defects. According to experts, your temperature (taken under the arm) should be less than 38.2 degrees C / 101 degrees F after exercising. Also, make sure your maternity bra offers enough support.
<br/>
<br/>You&#39;ll also need athletic shoes that fit your feet properly to help support ligaments and tendons. If your shoe size has changed because of mild swelling, buy a new, comfortable pair.
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Warm up before exercising</h2>
Warm ups do just that – they warm up your muscles and joints to prepare your body for exercise, and help build your heart rate up slowly. If you skip the warm up and jump into strenuous activity before your body is ready, you could strain your ligaments and hurt yourself.
<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Keep moving</h2>
Standing motionless for prolonged stretches, which certain yoga and dance positions call for, can decrease blood flow to the uterus and cause blood to pool in your legs, making you dizzy. Keep moving – change positions or walk in place.
<h2 id='section5' name='section5'>Avoid exercising while flat on your back after the first trimester</h2>
Besides being uncomfortable, this position can cause dizziness. It puts your uterus squarely on top of the vena cava, a major blood vessel, diminishing blood flow to your brain and uterus. Sit up on your elbows instead, or lie on your side.
<h2 id='section6' name='section6'>Don&#39;t do deep knee bends, lunges, or full sit-ups</h2>
These positions can cause ligament strain, and may increase the chance of tearing in the pelvic area. Instead, switch to other activities which tone the same muscles. <a href="swimming.html">Swimming</a> and <a href="/a7863/walking">walking</a> will work the quadriceps and buttock areas just as well as lunges and knee bends.
<h2 id='section7' name='section7'>Avoid overdoing it</h2>
Don&#39;t &quot;go for the burn&quot; and don&#39;t exercise to exhaustion. Some women like to monitor their heart rate while exercising, but it is not a good idea to rely on heart rate alone, as heart rates can vary widely in pregnancy. A good rule of thumb is to slow down if you can&#39;t comfortably carry on a conversation.
<h2 id='section8' name='section8'>If you feel uncomfortable or are in pain, stop immediately</h2>
Listen to your body. When something hurts, something&#39;s wrong, so stop. You should feel like you&#39;re working your body, not punishing it. Be on the look out for signs of danger.
<h2 id='section9' name='section9'>Drink lots of water before, during, and after exercising</h2>
If you don&#39;t drink plenty of fluids, you can get dehydrated, which can cause contractions and raise body temperature, sometimes to levels that are dangerous for you and the baby. Try drinking about two glasses of water two hours before you begin exercising. Drink another glass or two of water every 15 to 20 minutes during your workout.
<h2 id='section10' name='section10'>Get up from the floor slowly and carefully</h2>
Your centre of gravity shifts during pregnancy. That&#39;s why you should take great care when you shift positions. Getting up quickly can make you dizzy, and cause you to lose your footing and fall.
<h2 id='section11' name='section11'>Avoid outdoor activities when it&#39;s hot and humid</h2>
Pregnant or not, take it easy when the sun is blazing hot and the air is as humid as a thick, wet blanket. Weather like this makes you prone to overheating. On particularly hot or humid days, give your workout a miss or exercise indoors in a well-ventilated room.
<h2 id='section12' name='section12'>Steer clear of dangerous sports</h2>
Because your joints are looser than normal, it&#39;s best if you avoid any activity that could make you slip or fall, increasing the risk of injury to your abdomen. Horse riding, downhill skiing, mountain climbing, and most contact sports (football, basketball and so on) are not recommended. Racket sports, such as tennis and squash, are to be avoided if you&#39;re not a regular player, as they can be tough on your knees.
<h2 id='section13' name='section13'>Cool down</h2>
Walk in place for a few minutes or stretch. It gives your heart a chance to return gradually to its normal rate.
