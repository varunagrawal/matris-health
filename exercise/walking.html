					One of the best exercises for pregnant women, walking keeps you fit without jarring your knees and ankles. It&#39;s also a safe activity throughout the nine months of pregnancy and one of the easier ways to start exercising if you are not a regular exerciser.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you&#39;ve been walking, keep it up. If you were fairly inactive before you became pregnant, start with a slow walk and build yourself up to brisk 20 to 30 minute jaunts. You could alternate a few minutes at a brisk pace with a few minutes at a slower pace. It&#39;s best to exercise at least three times a week. Working out infrequently can put you at risk of injury; plus, you don&#39;t benefit from exercise by working out only once in a while. Remember to do your pelvic floor exercises while you are walking.
					<br />
					<br />
					Take a drink of water along with you when you go for a walk to avoid dehydration, which can cause contractions and raise <a href="avoid-overheating-during-exercise.html">body temperature</a>, sometimes to levels that are dangerous for you and the baby.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>First trimester</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					You won&#39;t need to stray too far from your normal walking habits, but make sure you have proper walking shoes so that your feet get the support they need. If it&#39;s hot and humid outside, skip the walk entirely. Weather like this makes you prone to overheating. Although there&#39;s no proof of a danger to humans, some animal studies suggest that overheating can cause birth defects. Follow the <a href="tips-for-a-safe-workout.html">safety guidelines</a> before beginning any exercise programme in pregnancy.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Second trimester</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					You may now feel more ungainly, so pay attention to your posture when you walk to avoid straining your back. Keep your head straight, your chin level, your hips tucked under your shoulders to avoid arching your back, and your eyes on what lies ahead. Swing your arms for balance and to intensify your workout.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Third trimester</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					Keep doing what you have been for as long as you can. Given that you can barely see your feet for your abdomen, you may want to avoid hiking trails or any uneven terrain that could put you off-balance.
