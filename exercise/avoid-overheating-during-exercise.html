<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>What&#39;s the danger of getting overheated while exercising?</h2>
Although there&#39;s no proof of a danger to humans, some animal studies suggest that overheating, especially in the early months of pregnancy, may cause birth defects. To be on the safe side, avoid overheating through exercise, especially in the first trimester.
<br/>
<br/>
Sauna and Jacuzzi use</a> in early pregnancy - which also raises body temperature - is not recommended either.
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>What body temperature is considered too high?</h2>
Your temperature (taken under the arm) should be less than 38.2 degrees C / 101 degrees F after exercising.
<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>What are some ways to stay cool?</h2><ul><li>
Don&#39;t exercise for long periods if it&#39;s too hot or humid outside.</li><br/>
<li>
Wear proper workout clothes</li><br/>
<li>
Drink plenty of fluids because dehydration raises body temperature. Drink about half a litre /a pint of water or a sports drink two hours before you begin exercising. During your workout, drink another glass or two of water every 15 to 20 minutes. (You&#39;ll also want to keep these guidelines in mind after the birth, especially if you&#39;re <a href="/c593/breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a>.)</li><br/>
<li>
Check that you are exercising at an appropriate intensity for you by how hard you feel you&#39;re exercising, rather than relying on heart rates. Now that you are pregnant, you should not be pushing yourself to extreme levels.
