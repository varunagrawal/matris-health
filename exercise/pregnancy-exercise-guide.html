						If you want to exercise, we have all the latest advice and guidance on how to keep fit safely during pregnancy.<br />
						<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>How can exercise help me during pregnancy?</h2>Regular exercise can help you to cope with the physical and mental demands of being pregnant, and prepare you for the rigours of labour. All those pregnancy niggles, such as back ache, constipation and fatigue, will be easier to keep at bay, too.<br />
						<br />
						Maintaining a healthy level of fitness is all part of staying well during pregnancy. We know that exercise can help prevent problems such as pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes. Exercise can improve your general mood and self-image, and you may find that a workout during the day helps you to sleep better at night.<br />
						<br />
						You&#39;ll find it easier to control your weight gain if you exercise. This benefit continues after your baby is born, making it easier for you to get back into shape.<br />
						<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Which forms of exercise are best for pregnant women?</h2>The best types of exercise during pregnancy: <br /><br />
						<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item">get your heart pumping</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">keep you supple</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">manage weight gain</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">prepare your muscles for the work of labour and birth</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">do not cause undue physical stress for you or your baby</li>
						</ul>
						
						Walking, jogging, swimming and aquanatal classes, and cycling on an exercise bike are all considered good, safe forms of exercise, as long as you don&#39;t overdo them. Yoga and Pilates are also ideal, as long as you find a registered, qualified teacher who is experienced in dealing with pregnant women<br />
						<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Which activities are not recommended?</h2>Sports where you might have a hard fall or be thrown off-balance are not a good idea. These include horse-riding, skiing, gymnastics and waterskiing. Diving is also unsafe during pregnancy. Ball sports such as football, tennis and squash are also risky, because you may be hit in the stomach.<br />
						<br />
						Most doctors recommend giving up cycling on the road after the second trimester. Even if you&#39;re an experienced cyclist, there&#39;s a danger you&#39;ll fall or be knocked off your bike. It&#39;s also a good idea to steer clear of pot-holed roads and traffic snarls! You can, however, use an exercise bike throughout pregnancy, but do get your doctor&#39;s approval first.<br />
						<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>If I&#39;ve never exercised before, what precautions should I take?</h2>As long as you get the go-ahead from your doctor, you can engage in mild to moderate exercise up to three times a week. Pregnancy is not the right time to begin any new vigorous regimes if you are not used to them.<br />
						<br />
						Stick to low-impact activities such as walking, yoga or swimming, and keep workout sessions short. See our article on <a href="exercises-recommended-throughout-pregnancy.html">exercises for pregnancy</a>. You could join an antenatal exercise class, so you know that all the movements are safe for you.<br />
						<h2 id='section5' name='section5'>How hard can I exercise now that I&#39;m pregnant?</h2>While you&#39;re pregnant, try to achieve a good level of fitness, rather than going for peak fitness. As a rule, you should be able to hold a normal conversation while you&#39;re exercising.<br />
						<br />
						Aim to exercise for about 30 minutes, three times a week. Exercising too often, say, five or more times a week, may do more harm than good. It may make you more likely to give birth to a small or low birth weight baby. <br />
						<br />
						If you used to do high-intensity workouts before you became pregnant, it&#39;s best to ease off now. High-impact workouts may put too much stress on your joints and pelvic floor muscles. <br />
						<br />
						You can gradually build yourself back up to your old regime after you have had your baby.<br />
						<br />
						You shouldn&#39;t exercise to exhaustion. Listen to your body and stop if you feel tired or that you&#39;ve done too much. Some women like to monitor their heart rate while exercising. However, don&#39;t rely on this alone, as heart rates in pregnancy can vary widely. <br />
						<br />
						<b>Stop exercising immediately if you have any of the following:</b> <br /><br/>
						<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item">chest, leg joint or tummy pain</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">dizziness or faintness</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">shortness of breath</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">vaginal bleeding</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">difficulty walking</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">contractions</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						It&#39;s also a good idea to stay aware of your baby&#39;s movements. If they appear to slow down or stop, have a rest. Do bear in mind, though, that your baby is often most quiet when you&#39;re exercising. If things don&#39;t feel right or you are at all unsure, it&#39;s always best to err on the side of caution and see your doctor</a>.<br />
						<h2 id='section6' name='section6'>Should I change my routine as my pregnancy progresses?</h2>Yes. Even if you were very active before your pregnancy, you&#39;ll probably want to scale down your exercise routine as your baby grows. During the first trimester it&#39;s especially important that you don&#39;t overheat. <br />
						<br />
						After the first trimester, you&#39;ll also need to skip any exercises that involve you lying flat on your back or standing in one place for long periods. Both can reduce blood flow to your baby. <br />
						<h2 id='section7' name='section7'>Are there any reasons why I shouldn&#39;t exercise?</h2>Some women need to take extra care when exercising. You should talk to your doctor before exercising if: <br />
						<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item">you have had a premature baby or a threatened miscarriage before.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you have very low iron levels in your blood (severe anaemia).</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">your baby has been small for dates during this pregnancy.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you have high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you are very overweight or underweight.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you have any joint or muscle problems.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you have any heart or lung problems. </li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you are expecting twins.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you have diabetes.</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<b>you should not exercise at all if:</b> <br />
						<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item">you have gone into premature labour or had a threatened miscarriage during your current pregnancy.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you have a low-lying placenta (placenta praevia) after you are 26 weeks pregnant.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you have cervical weakness (also called cervical incompetence).</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you are pregnant with three or more babies. </li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you have serious heart or lung disease.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you have persistent vaginal bleeding.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">you have very high blood pressure.</li>
						</ul>
