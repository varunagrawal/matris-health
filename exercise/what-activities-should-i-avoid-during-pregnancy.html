					You should avoid any activity that puts you at risk of falling, getting hurt or causing harm to you and your growing baby.<br />
					<br />
					<b>Adventure activities and sports</b> <br />
					River rafting, waterskiing, horse riding, snowboarding, downhill skiing or surfing may be your favourite sports but put them all on hold while you&#39;re pregnant. That includes activities like tennis or cycling if you&#39;re not used to them, as your sense of balance may be altered. <br />
					<br />
					Extreme sports like bungee jumping are also ruled out as are adventure activities like hiking, rock climbing and mountain climbing. Vigorous jogging that puts pressure on your joints or back should also be avoided.<br />
					<br />
					<b>Contact sports</b> <br />
					And stay away from doing any contact sports where there is a risk of you being hit in the belly, such as squash, kickboxing, judo, karate or taekwondo. It is also a good idea to avoid football, basketball or beach volley ball. <br />
					<br />
					<b>Diving</b><br />
					Scuba diving is also out, since air bubbles can form in your bloodstream as you surface. These bubbles can be very dangerous for both you and your growing baby.<br />
					<br />
					<b>High altitude activities</b><br />
					Activities that take you to high altitudes, such as sky diving, hot air ballooning and mountaineering, should also be avoided, because of the change in oxygen levels.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Amusement park rides</b><br />
					Waterslides, roller coasters and most amusement park rides are off your list too. They often involve a forceful landing, or sudden speeding up or slowing down that could harm your baby.<br />
					<br />
					<b>Activities that cause overheating</b><br />
					Some studies show that raising your temperature during early pregnancy can increase the risk of birth defects, so stay out of saunas, jacuzzis and hot tubs, too. Steam baths which are sometimes part of <i>Ayurvedic</i> treatments are also best avoided for the same reason. <br />
					<br />
					To stop yourself from <a href="avoid-overheating-during-exercise.html">overheating</a>, try not to exercise in hot weather. And if you were a couch potato before you got pregnant, don&#39;t suddenly take up strenuous exercise now.<br />
					<br />
					After 16 weeks of pregnancy, avoid exercise that involves lying flat on your back with raised legs, such as sit-ups. The weight of your uterus (womb) may press on major blood vessels, making you feel faint or dizzy. <br />
