					Swimming improves circulation, increases muscle tone and strength, and builds endurance. But the reason we like swimming is because it makes you feel almost weightless. And it&#39;s almost impossible to hurt yourself. &quot;Swimming was one of only a few things that made me feel good during pregnancy,&quot; says Shivani, mother of 10-month-old Antraa. &quot;I was buoyant. When I was in the water, I felt like I hadn&#39;t gained any weight. Plus it made my muscles feel better.&quot;
					<br />
					<br />
					Before you take the plunge, check first with your doctor. If you were an avid swimmer before you got pregnant, you should be able to continue your usual regime. Even if this is all new to you, you&#39;ll still be able to take to the water as long as you&#39;re careful.
					<br />
					<br />
					Start slowly, warm up and cool down gradually, and don&#39;t over-exert yourself or exercise too hard. Just remember: all you want to do is stay fit, so take it easy and save the gruelling multi-lap workouts for after the birth.
					<br />
					<br />
					Choose a stroke which feels comfortable for you. Alternating breaststroke with floating on your back and gently kicking your legs will give you a good all-round workout. Avoid breaststroke if you have pain in your pubic symphysis joint at the front of your pelvis.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>First trimester</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					If energy permits, go for a swim for at least 20 minutes every other day for maximum benefit. Swimming first thing in the morning may counteract morning sickness and energise you for the rest of the day.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Second trimester</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					Your pregnancy won&#39;t require you to cut down on swimming as you grow since it&#39;s easy on expectant mothers. The water supports your joints and ligaments as you exercise, preventing injury, and protects you from overheating.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Third trimester</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					You probably won&#39;t need to modify your regime, but a maternity swimsuit may be more comfortable now that you&#39;re well into your pregnancy. Look out for local antenatal / aquanatal exercise classes offered by a qualified instructor. Follow our guidelines to avoid <a href="avoid-overheating-during-exercise.html">overheating</a>.
					<br />
					<br />
					It may be worthwhile to ensure that the swimming pool you use has a valid licence and trained staff to handle any emergency. Also do check the hygiene and cleanliness levels in public pools. Often pools are not maintained well enough and may become the breeding ground for waterborne infections and diseases.
