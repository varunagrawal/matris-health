					<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>Is dancing safe in pregnancy?</h2>
					Dancing is a safe and fun way to exercise during pregnancy. If dancing is new to you, it is best to stick to a gentle dance class, such as zumba, that doesn’t involve jumping, and isn’t too strenuous.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you have been dancing for a while, tell your doctor that you would like to continue just to be sure it is suitable for you. You may need to make a few modifications to your usual dance routine, particularly as your pregnancy progresses. <br />
					<br />
					Dance types that are strenuous and involve moves such as standing on one leg for a long time, or excessive jumping, stretching or kicking, will need to be modified.
					Your dance teacher should be able to help with this.<br />
					<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>How will dancing help to keep me fit?</h2>
					Dancing to music will help to keep you flexible and strengthen your muscles. A reasonably fast-paced dance class, such as <i>kathak</i> will give you an aerobic workout, which will make your heart and lungs work harder. This will make you fitter and give you more energy.
					<br />
					<br />
					A strengthening dance class, such as ballet, if you&#39;re used to doing it, will keep your muscles strong and toned, and may help with balance and coordination.
					<br />
					<br />
					Try to dance for at least 30 minutes, three or four times a week, whether it&#39;s in your living room, or at a class. Even better, combine dancing with another form of regular exercise, such as swimming or pregnancy yoga, so that you don&#39;t over-train or strain your muscles<span class="citation"></span>.
					<br />
					<h2 id='section3' name='section3'>Which types of dance are best in pregnancy?</h2>
					Try to choose a dedicated pregnancy dance class, if there&#39;s one in your area, or a low-impact aerobic dance class. The emphasis should be on maintaining fitness, rather than improving it<span class="citation"></span>.
					<br />
					<br />
					However, if you have a healthy pregnancy, and you feel well when exercising, you may be able to increase your fitness levels. Always tell your instructor that you&#39;re pregnant, though.
					<br />
					<br />
					Low-impact exercise, which involves keeping one foot on the floor at all times, doesn&#39;t stress your joints as much. Hormonal changes in pregnancy make you more prone to injury<span class="citation"> </span>if you over-stretch or stress your joints.
					<br />
					<br />
					Many of the traditional Indian dance forms may become more difficult to continue with as your pregnancy progresses and you start getting a larger tummy. You can switch to more gentle forms of dancing or opt for a different form of exercise such as walking or swimming to stay in shape though. This will help you maintain your physical fitness so you can pick up where you left off after pregnancy. <br />
					<h2 id='section4' name='section4'>Which types of dance should I avoid?</h2>
					Hip-hop, urban and street dance aren&#39;t ideal when you&#39;re pregnant, because the movements are too jerky.
					<br />
					<br />
					You should only do ballet in pregnancy if you are used to it. Ballet stretches can place a lot of pressure on your joints, especially your pelvic joints, and standing on one leg can cause pain in your pelvis.
					<br />
					<br />
					<i>
						Bharatnatyam
					</i> and <i>kuchipudi</i>, which involve jumps, squats and bends, may be damaging to your joints when you&#39;re pregnant and may put pressure on your pelvic floor. If you&#39;d like to continue with these dances, swap jumps and squats for gentler steps.
					<br />
					<br />
					Avoid any forms of dance that are particularly strenuous or vigorous. Exercise that leaves you exhausted could be unsafe and may cause you to overheat. So you may need to take things down a notch.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you listen to your body, you&#39;re unlikely to overdo things. Moderate exercise should make you feel mildly out of breath and only slightly sweaty.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you become exhausted, and can&#39;t carry on talking or singing to the music, or you feel dizzy, slow down or sit down for a few minutes, until you recover. This is a sign that you and your baby may be getting less oxygen<span class="citation"></span>. Always adjust the intensity of your dancing according to how you feel.
					<br />
					<br />
					Avoid any forms of dance that involve jumps and leaps and sudden, fast changes of direction, such as twists and turns, because you may lose your balance and fall over.
					<br />
					<br />
					Always stay facing in the same direction. Back bends, strong pelvic twists, and strong hip movements all carry a risk of straining your back and pelvic joints, which loosen in pregnancy to make room for the birth of your baby<span class="citation"></span>. <br />
					<h2 id='section5' name='section5'>What else should I bear in mind when dancing?</h2>
					In your first trimester, if your pregnancy is going well, and if you&#39;re feeling up to it, you can dance as you would normally, but keep a few precautions in mind.
					<br />
					<br />
					Warm up properly beforehand to prepare your joints and muscles for exercise. This will also build up your heart rate gradually, and cool you down slowly afterwards. Skipping a warm-up could strain your ligaments and joints, which could cause injury.
					<br />
					<br />
					Always take a bottle of water with you to your class and drink plenty before, during and after, so that you don&#39;t get dehydrated. Eat a light snack before your session.
					<br />
					<br />
					Choose a dance studio that&#39;s well-ventilated or has air conditioning, to prevent you from overheating. You could also try a pregnancy dance DVD, but you won&#39;t have the benefit of your instructor&#39;s experience.
					<br />
					<br />
					Make sure you regularly practise pelvic floor exercises to make sure that you don’t begin to leak while you&#39;re dancing.
					<br />
					<br />
					As your pregnancy progresses, and your bump gets bigger, you may need to make your dance sessions shorter and less intense. You may also find it harder to maintain your balance. Slow down if you need to. Never force yourself into a position. If something hurts, or it becomes difficult to perform, don&#39;t do it.<br />
					<h2 id='section6' name='section6'>When should I not dance?</h2>
					If you have a chronic health condition, or a pregnancy complication, such as gestational diabetes, it&#39;s especially important to talk to your doctor before exercising.
					<br />
					<br />
					If you have problems with your back or pelvis, such as pelvic girdle pain, dancing may put your joints under too much strain. You may be recommended to only exercise under medical supervision, or to choose a more gentle form of exercise.<br />
