<h2 id='section1' name='section1'>What conditions might prevent me from exercising while pregnant?</h2>
Sometimes exercise during pregnancy is forbidden to protect the health of the mother, the baby, or both. Check with your doctor or midwife before starting, continuing, or changing an exercise regime. If you have any of the following conditions, you may need to take extra care and will probably be advised not to exercise for the duration of your pregnancy.
<br/>
<ul><li>
If you have very high blood pressure.</li><br/>
<li>
If your waters have broken early, otherwise known as Premature Rupture of the Membranes (PROM).</li><br/>
<li>
If you have had a previous premature baby, or know that you are at risk of premature labour this time.</li><br/>
<li>
If you have an incompetent cervix.</li><br/>
<li>
If you have persistent second or third trimester vaginal bleeding.</li><br/>
<li>
If your baby is very &quot;small for dates&quot; and has been defined as having intrauterine growth restriction, otherwise known as IUGR, where the fetus is growing too slowly, possibly resulting in a low birthweight baby.</li><br/>
<li>
If you have placenta praevia, also known as a low-lying placenta, after 20 weeks. </li><br/>
<li>
If you have heart disease.
</li></ul>
<br/>
If there are concerns about your pregnancy, check with your doctor to establish exactly what type of activity is forbidden. You may still be able to do some limited exercises, such as routines to strengthen your arms and back, or <a href="walking.html">walking</a>.
<h2 id='section2' name='section2'>Are there warning signs that mean I should stop exercising?</h2>
If you have any of the following symptoms while exercising, slow down gradually and stop the exercise you are doing, then contact your doctor or midwife:
<br/><ul><li>
Pain</li><br/>
<li>
Dizziness</li><br/>
<li>
Shortness of breath</li><br/>
<li>
Feeling faint</li><br/>
<li>
Vaginal bleeding</li><br/>
<li>
Difficulty walking</li><br/>
<li>
Back or pelvic pain</li><br/>
<li>
Contractions</li><br/>
<li>
Unusual absence of fetal movements (but bear in mind that the baby is often most quiet when you&#39;re exercising)
</li></ul>
<br/>
You should also discontinue your exercise programme and contact your midwife or doctor if you have a rapid heartbeat while resting.
<br/>
<br/>
If you experience pain in the pubic bone at the front of your pelvis when walking upstairs or standing on one leg, you may have a condition known as symphysis pubis dysfunction (SPD). Speak to your doctor or midwife, as it is important not only to avoid stressing the joint during exercise, but also during labour. Ask to be referred to a physiotherapist specialising in women&#39;s health, who can advise you on how to deal with the symptoms during pregnancy.
